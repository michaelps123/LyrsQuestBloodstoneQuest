## NIGHT OFFICE ASSET RESOURCE MANAGEMENT


SCOPE: This Advanced Psychological Strategies assessment exercise is a training manual used by Night Office Asset Resource Management. The exercise requires the use of a Personal Therapeutic Construct, and all field operatives who undertake this APS must have completed at least 36 hours of PINEAL training in the creation of, management of, and dismissal of self-actualized therapeutic personalities.

This assessment tests the integrity of various nth-dimensional sub-structures of the psychological matrices, as well as the field operative's neural fexibility and capacity for mental peregrinations without suffering psychotic degradation. Results from this exercise will be tabulated into a Mental Acuity and Psychological Stability score, which will be recorded in the field operative's Life Integrity Existential Schematic.

Commentary in regards to the relative success or failure of any given end point within this exercise is provided to downplay any lasting mental, emotional, physical, or psychological scarring that may occur.

Night Office Asset Resource Management makes every effort to keep these training manuals in accordance with the most current policies, procedures, and practical applications of relevant esoteric knowledge, but Night Office Asset Resource Management offers no assurances that materials are truly up-to-date.
