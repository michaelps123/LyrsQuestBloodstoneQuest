# Introduction
As an IT professional, it is important for you to communicate with colleagues and navigate workplace situations. Being able to understand the different behavioral styles of individual team members and develop strategic thinking skills will help you choose appropriate communication techniques and influence tactics to effectively work with them. It will also help you evaluate situations from different points of view and recommend effective strategies for decision-making.   
  
For this task, you will use the scenario, the attached “Implementation Email,” and the “Implementation Meeting” video found in the Web Links section to reflect upon the communication demonstrated and find opportunities for improvement.


# Scenario
You were recently hired as the implementation team lead for Seamus Company. After completing your orientation and onboarding period, you are assigned as the point of contact on a company-wide equipment upgrade project that has been delayed once already. Your supervisor, Kamal, who also serves as the committee chair of the project, is looking to you to get this project launched quickly and effectively. While there are over a dozen teams on your list to upgrade, you have proposed an initial, single-team rollout to pilot your implementation plan and resolve any unforeseen issues in that plan. You asked Kamal to select the best team for your pilot rollout. Kamal identified two potential teams and scheduled a meeting with the team managers and a data analyst to decide which team should be prioritized for the equipment upgrades. This is a critical decision that your team is waiting on to start planning. You were unable to attend the meeting due to a schedule conflict, but you are able to view the recording.  
  
Since you are new to the organization, you have not yet built relationships with any of the people who attended the meeting. Kamal recorded the meeting and shared it, along with the meeting minutes, via email. You also see that Diego, the manager of Team A, requested time to meet with you one on one. While the project is behind schedule and you have only been assigned to this role for one week, you cannot move forward with planning until you know which team to prioritize in the rollout. Following the events of the initial meeting, you are tasked with analyzing the meeting and recommending opportunities for improvement to be communicated to your team.

# MY ANSERS
##################################################
A.   Reflect on the “Implementation Meeting” video and the “Implementation Email” by doing the following:
1.   Discuss **two** examples of effective communication in either the meeting video or the implementation email.
	1. In the email, Kamal does a good job of proving both the meeting notes and the concerns expressed by the attendees. A lot of what takes place in any meeting is the social queues expressed by attendees, both visually and verbally. Kamal does a good job of conveying the attitudes of participants for the Implementation Team Lead
	2. In the meeting, Kamal does a good job of acknowledging attendees' opinions and keeping the meeting moving.

2.   Identify **two** opportunities for improvement in communication in either the meeting video or the implementation email.
	1. In the email, there was some unnecessary personal information provided with the background of each person on the call. I appreciate some color in the descriptions of individuals and their motivations, but some of the information provided was unnecessary. This should not be included and a one-on-one conversation with Kamal would most likely clear this up.
	2. In the meeting, To reduce interruptions, I might say up front what the agenda was and how I would manage the call. One thing I might have stated is that I would be going down the roster and asking for input from each attendee and reducing interruptions. 

3.   Discuss **two** communication improvements you would make as a team leader in the meeting video or implementation email.
	1. As stated previously, in the email I would want to reduce the extraneous personal information and strictly adhere to facts and note where people expressed concerns or found gaps in the data. 
	2. In the meeting, I would have started from the start how the meeting was to be conducted with more instruction to the participants. This would baseline the meeting etiquette and result in less interruption.

4.   Describe **two** different methods you would use to communicate the improvements from part A3 to your team. Include your reasoning for choosing _each_ method.  
	1. For the email, I would schedule a 1:1 meeting with Kamal to review the meeting notes and discuss ways to streamline the meeting notes and remove extraneous information.  
	2. For the meeting, I would include meeting etiquette guidelines and agenda topics in the meeting invites. This would socialize how the meeting would be conducted before the meetings started and would be reviewed at the start of the meeting.
