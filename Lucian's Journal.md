## Journal
###### Year Twenty Five
- I have finally killed my master Revallic. His meddling in my affairs had grown to much to bear any further. I cannot say that he was a particularly good or bad person, but I could not allow him to interfere with my goals any longer. My goals now far exceeded his. He was content with having me work at the advisor for Lord Vardis Varren, and playing the tedious game of politics and thrones that everyone else was playing. Tiny maneuvers here and there that would lead to minor gains and losses, a zero sum game. I wanted more, I wanted to never depend on anyone or anything ever again. I would not ask, but would take what I wanted and when I wanted. I would not be stopped by the whims and fancies of lesser men.
- I cannot blame Revallic though. He had purchased me from my parents when I was ten. He said that I 'had the spark' and that he could fan it into something more. What I can remember, my parents had been kind enough and they may even have saw this as an opportunity for me to have more than their existence could ever provide. Or they may have seen it as a way to unburden themselves of another mouth to feed. My memories of them are few now and are of now help to me now.
- Revallic had been strict and harsh, but had also provided me with food, shelter and knowledge. He was a minor sorcerer with small ambitions. But never believe that he was kind or benevolent. I - and various other children - had been under his tutelage. I was one that survived, I had potential and I was worth something. Many others had been sacrificed as needed. I had seen it with my own eyes. Some magics are hungry for flesh, and some for souls. 
- This is a time when magic is considered taboo, but all of the nobles employed some member of the Arcane arts. Most commoners and of course - zealots of the religious orders consider anything beyond their understanding to be intrinsically evil or suspect. So practitioners like myself must work from the shadows. My former master thought to use me such a manner. He introduced me to Lord Varren and wanted to work his will through me as his proxy. This insulated my master in case I was discovered and yet allowed him to curry influence without direct exposure. This was mutually beneficial to myself and my master. I was already growing as powerful as he and I needed my own space to practice my arts away from him. I think he also wanted to distance himself from me as he recognized my strength. 
- After Revallic convinced Lord Varren to employ me in his service, I waited and I played his game for several years. I advised, I steered Lord Varren's focus on specific issues and help him maneuver and crush his opponents when needed. Some of these conflicts were of Lord Varrens make, and others were more manufactured to serve Revallic. But really, they all served Revallic to some end. Revallic was a smart parasite, and made sure to never harm the host organism, but whatever the situation, it must not harm the parasite. Revallic's error was not understanding my needs, and what would benefit me. He assumed I was happy as the 'advisor' to a noble house and living as this intermediary.   
- I became aware of an almost undetectable poison that causes a deep sleep and paralysis for an length of hours and acquired a small amount. Then, at one of our scheduled dinner meetings to discuss his plans, I made sure he ingested the poison at the end. As usual he departed to his sleep chambers at the end of the meal where I was expected to show myself out. This time I merely waited an hour and then checked on his status. I could do nothing to rouse him. I then set his room afire and watched as the flames began to consume him and everything within the chamber and walked away. I had conflicting feelings, but I knew this is what had to be done. My master would not have hesitated to sacrifice me for his own gain and it was time that I became master of my own destiny. The only kindness I offered was to make sure his new apprentices got out, but otherwise, I wanted every part of Revallic's existence burned from this world.
###### Year Twenty Six through Twenty Eight
> - Game mechanic I draw the Mundane Truth "Ace of Diamonds":
> 	- "The fundamental secrets of reality, whispered to the first mage to ever walk this world. A gift hidden in the firmament."
> 	- "Elder trees never die, their roots extend below ground and control the undying cycle of nature. You learn the reason for their eternal existence, or find a way to merge your body into the immortal tree."
> 		- A truth of this world that gives you power over death and places you above all other mortals, giving you a chance at immortality. 
> 			- Where do you find it?
> 				1. The fundamental secrets of reality, whispered to the first mage to ever walk this world. A gift hidden in the firmament.
> 				2. Revealed by the ancient traditions and legends of a disappearing tribe. You had to submit them to your will to reveal their secrets. 
> 				3. Discovered by alchemical research and bloody experimentation at the costof many lives.
> 			- What is it?
> 				1. Rejuvenate your ageing body by consuming the flesh of the youthful under a blood moon.
> 				2. Life force can be extracted from mortals from the distillation of their humours, producing pure life essence that will extend your life and give you strength.
> 				3. Elder trees never die, their roots extend below ground and control the undying cycle of nature. You learn the reason for their eternal existence, or fi nd a way to merge your body into the immortal tree.
- When I burned my former master, I took his writings with me. Some, I had seen before, but others were his private grimoire's and diaries. It was obvious he had read many old texts that I had never seen, and had taken studious notes and reproduced many of the illustrations. But he had failed to make connections that seemed obvious to me. Over the next year, I spent great amounts of time and resources locating some of the texts listed. I could only assume there was more in them than even Revallic had captured. 
- Many of the dealers in old books and manuscripts were friendly to my coin, but some of them did not appreciate the subject matters I pursued. I had to to be careful with whom I worked with.
- At one point I had enough leads that I had to travel from Ashenhold to Thornspire to consult more of these dealers in lost arcane writings. 
- Eventually I made the connection to the Elder trees energies and theory on how to harness this. This lead me on an expedition to one such tree out in Shadowfen Reach. I spent many nights there with workers, digging deep into the earth to reach the roots below. After some time, I uncovered that through specific incantations and alchemic mixtures, one could merge the mind and body with the the tree itself! This was so close to my desire to be free from the power of those lesser than myself, but not close enough. It burned in me though! This must be useful somehow, this must be a part.
- In all this time I was of course still working for Lord Varren in Ashenhold. On each of the extended excursions, I crafted stories of arcane powers and concoctions that would aid my Lord in his greater glories. Some of these were as simple as needing rare ingredients for divination to further guide him, others were as complex as love potions or some other foolishness for him to seduce or bind his enemies to his will. As my needs grew, my promises to Lord Varren grew more varied and wild. He was a younger noble when he first employed me and his thirsts and desires had grown over the years. For the time, my true intents remained hidden beneath his.
###### Year Twenty Nine
> - I draw the Eight of Diamonds. Diamond are always "Mundane Violent"
> - "Assassins are sent against you by your most hated enemies. You have been suspecting their intentions for a long time, but never thought they would dare to openly move against you. Especially in such a crude way. You have no option but to retaliate; but you won’t fail, and their screams will reverberate in the vaults and corridors of your domain for many long days.
> 	- Who sent them against you and why?
> 	- How did you survive and how did you take revenge?
> 	- How did they attempt murder?"
> - For "How did they attempt murder?" I roll a three: 
> 	- 3 "A shadow demon hidden in the body of a servant tried to steal your soul."
> - For "How did they get close to you?" I rolled a one:
> 	- 1. "Someone helped them to defeat your protections with sorcerous knowledge. "
> - for the who, I come up with the following:
> 	- A rival of Lord Varren named Lord Calanthor was attempting to broker a trade agreement with a neighboring city state. Lucian discovered that his sorceress named Mirabel Bloodrose was manipulating the negotiations. Lucian out-magicked her and instead steered the negotiation in Varren's favor. He had never seen this type of magical manipulation done before and was able to do it better than Mirabel. Being outmaneuvered by someone Mirabel sees as an inferior magic user infuriated her, not to mention displeased Calanthor. She now has a burning hatred for Lucian.
- One night like any other, Lucian was finishing his studies when the servant came in.  As he walked over to inspect the food, the face of the servant began to transform into a hideous demonic visage. Stepping back, Lucian was able to put up a shield quickly but was unprepared for the onslaught of magical attacks. The Demon sensing Lucian's weakness, presses the attack and further strains Lucian. Knowing he is about to fail and die, Lucian taps strength from his very life force, using it to augment his powers. He delivers a blow that obliterates the demon
- Staggering to his knees, Lucian knows he has taken a drastic measure to defeat the demaon and shortened his mortal life by tapping into his life force. But that is a problem for another today, today he had lived.
- In the aftermath, Lucian realizes that the demon's magical signature bears the unmistakable mark of Mirabel Bloodrose. He grits his teeth as he should have seen this coming, he should have been more prepared. He had been blinded by his search for knowledge lately and not paying enough attention to the games of politics. And he had not just thwarted Mirabel, he had arrogantly humiliated her. This was an inevitable result and he had not paid enough attention to see it coming. He would not make this mistake again.
- The other aspect he realizes, someone must have told Mirabel of his wards and defenses around his chamber. Someone with enough magical training to at least see them. The demon should never have been able to enter his chamber. He checked the wards and they were still in place. So they had not defeated his wards, simply bypassed them. Could a shadow demon in a a human actually do that? He did not know. 
- For now, he would double his protections, some outside the chamber and some within. He would also make sure they were slightly different, so the same 'bypass' could not be used on both. He would also no longer allow anyone in his chambers and take his meals elsewhere. Lastly, he would keep his eye out for a traitor. Maybe lay some magical traps for those that could see and were curious.

###### Year Thirty
> - I draw the Five of Hearts. Hearts are "Mundane Social" Events
> - An ancient noble house seeks your aid in desperation. Their gods and medicine have failed them, and they are now willing to make a pact with darkness to survive. Not all the arrogant rulers of the masses are your allies, but this opportunity is perfect to advance your agenda or slight a common enemy. 
> 	- Who needs desperate help and why do you provide it? 
> 	- What do you claim in return? Simple riches or an unassuming family heirloom that it’s older than they can imagine?
> 	- How do you banish their torment and who dies in the process? 
> 	- Who inflicts this bane upon them? Are they your enemy? If so, why do you hate them?
> - I roll a three and get the following issue for "What afflicts the noble house?":
> 	- The crops rot and the livestock fall prey to savage beasts summoned from other realities.
- House Aranthia is in peril and asking us for House Varren for assistance. Aranthia believes it is House Calanthor and the sorceress Mirabel Bloodrose that has caused this blight on their lands: The crops rot and the livestock fall prey to savage beasts summoned from other realities. 
- Lord Torvan of Aranthia heard rumors there was bad blood between House Varren and House Calanthor and hoped we might be willing to aid Aranthia to thwart Calanthor. Aranthia does not hard proof that it is Calanthor, but the magics used are similar to those the sorceress Bloodrose is known for and the magical energies 'feel' like her.
- The wizard for Aranthia (Seraphine Sunshard) is not a practitioner of the dark arts and cannot detect Bloodrose's magical signature as well as Lucian might. Knowing that, they have reached out to Lord Varren seeking aid. For Varren's assistance, they will pledge loyalty and whatever else we ask, since they have already suffered greatly from this blight and fear total ruin if something is not done soon.
- Aranthia is a strong and proud house, but this blight has been ongoing for a year now and they are desperate. House Varren is not as strong as either Aranthia or Calanthor, but this alliance would bolster Varren if they can successfully stop the blight and the attacks. 
- Since the attack the previous year on Lucian, he has a deep resentment and hatred for Bloodrose and is pushing Varren to negotiate with Aranthia to pursue this. Lucian wants to another chance to study Bloodrose's magics and another chance to thwart her. Lucian is willing now to engage her directly when the time comes after spending the previous years working on his defensive magics. 
- Lucian spends a year studying the effects on the lands, maybe he even traps one of the otherworldly beast's that emerge from other realities. He finds that the specific stones are cursed and poison the soil around them, weakening the veil between worlds and allowing these otherworldly beasts to enter our world.  
- Varren also aids this house with food shipments. House Aranthia would have starved without, and Torvan pledges an oath to House Varren for the aid. Lucian also asks for any books on the arcane to add to his library as his price for curing the land. Seraphine grudgingly agrees to this, but she does develop an appreciation for Lucian's abilities and dedication to his craft. They may be on opposite sides of the magical spectrum, but a respect and fondness is formed over the year spent working together.
- It may take a couple of more years for Aranthia to return to its former glory, but it is no longer in decline destined for ruin. It is also completely beholden to House Varren for saving it. Also, during the year Lucian and Seraphine spent studying the magics used to create the blight, Lucian reverse engineers the technique Mirabel Bloodrose used to create them. This opens several new paths for his own spell craft and increases his strength. 

###### Year Thirty
> - I draw the Six of Clubs - Clubs are Arcane Research Events.
> - Sixes are "Scheming and Scrying"
> 	- Swap a card between Certain and Uncertain futures
> 	- Pay cost with either 1 Doom, 1 Resolve, 1 Influence or another Scheming and Scrying card
> 	- Keep and use this card between events and then discard.
> - The event says the following:
> 	- By extensive and careful research in ancient tomes of sorcery, reading the shapes revealed in the smoke of a sacrifice, making abhorrent deals in the dark with powerful demons, or by any other unfathomable arcane means, you are able to discern your destiny from the entanglement of multiple realities other mortals call “future”.
> 	- You now have knowledge that makes allies seek your favour and enemies despair in fear of your vengeance. Use it well.
> 		- • What did you see in your future that disturbed you?
> 		- • How did you change the future to your advantage?
> 		- • What did this scrying ritual cost you and why cannot be repeated in the same way?
> 		- • What were you looking for in the future?
> 	- How do you read the future?
> 	1. You discern events yet to come from the prophetic verses written in the dried skin of a serpent-god.
> 	2. The entrails of human sacrifice speak of the secrets of powerful mortals and reveal horrors to come.
> 	3. Half-truths whispered from the darkness by a menacing demon that speaks in riddles and demands payment.
- I will save this card until we have something to sacrifice besides Resolve or Doom.
> - I draw the Eight of Spades. 
> - Spades are "Arcane Unnatural" events.
> - Cards 7-9 are adversity events
> - The card details are as follows: 
> 	- A truth of all realities that gives you power over death and places you above all other mortals, giving you a chance at immortality. 
> - Where do you find it?
> 	1. A dream quest. A ritual that allows your soul to travel to other planes and learn from the experience of many lives across disparate existences.
> 	2. In the future constellation of stars, as revealed by an artefact of an extinct race found within a tomb of unfathomable age.
> 	3. Signed a contract with a demon in exchange for abhorrent ritual sacrifices for the years to come.
> - What is it?
> 	1. Only death can give you immortality. Follow a terrible ritual of powerful sorcery in the name of forsaken gods to trap your soul in your body for all eternity.
> 	2. Copy your consciousness into several gems, perfectly synchronized by your governing soul, which is merged into the brains of an indestructible machine.
> 	3. Learn the true name of a powerful demon and force it to maintain your soul in the mortal plane or reveal the ritual of lichdom.
> - I roll a 1 and 2
> 	- 1. A dream quest. A ritual that allows your soul to travel to other planes and learn from the experience of many lives across disparate existences.
> 	- 2. Copy your consciousness into several gems, perfectly synchronized by your governing soul, which is merged into the brains of an indestructible machine.
- Lucian spends the next year deep in study. He has a new assortment of books obtained from the alliance with Aranthia, he learned many things through his interactions with Seraphine Sunshard as they worked together, and knew knowledge by reverse engineering the spells of Mirabel Bloodrose. With this, Lucian discovers a ritual that allows him to go into a dream quest like state.
- Lucian leaves behind the constraints of the physical realm, allowing himself to be guided by the ethereal whispers of the cosmos. He receives visions and clues there, but not answers. But the visions he receives, though cryptic, hold the seeds of revelation. 
- When he returns to the mortal plane, he builds a machine, a "constellation of crystalline vessels" that he can transfer his consciousness into, as well as his soul. The crystalline lattice will serve as a conduit, channeling his essence into the core of the device, as an immortal machine.
- Lucian thinks to himself: Even with this knowledge, it is not enough. It is not the answer, but another piece of the puzzle, another part to a greater answer he has not yet found. He does not want to exist as a machine, trapped in a body that cannot move. This is no better than the merging into the Elder trees. But it is another clue, another hint at what could be. He is closer now than he was before.
###### Year Thirty One
> - I draw the Seven of Diamonds. 
> - Diamonds are "Mundane Violent" events
> - Cards 7-9 are adversity events
> - The events for Eight of Spades are as follows:
> 	- You face a legendary beast of tremendous power. Folk tales shroud the creature in mysticism and fear, and history books tell the story of heroic mortals that perished in their attempt to destroy its dark soul.
> 		- Who dies in the fight?
> 		- Where do you fight it?
> 	- Why do you confront this beast?
> 		 1. It protects the Iron Eye of the Blind God, an artefact that allows strong minds to embark on a dangerous atavistic voyage. What horrors do you see in the distant past?
> 		2. You awakened it from its slumber of ages to find answers. What do you ask when you defeat it?
> 		3. You need its black and poisonous heart for a sorcerous concoction. What alchemy are you trying to create?
> 	- What is this creature?
> 		1. A serpent-demon with a tongue of stone and eyes that see into several realities.
> 		2. A tentacled horror beyond this world that consumes flesh and light with its demonic maw. 
> 		3. An intelligent and terrifying chimera escaped from the laboratory of a sorcerer.
> - I roll a 1 and a 2
> 	- Why do you confront this beast?
> 		 1. It protects the Iron Eye of the Blind God, an artefact that allows strong minds to embark on a dangerous atavistic voyage. What horrors do you see in the distant past?
> 	- What is this creature?
> 		2. A tentacled horror beyond this world that consumes flesh and light with its demonic maw. 
 - The alliance with Aranthia continues to yield fruit as Lucian also deciphers a text that describes the location of the "Iron Eye of the Blind God". This artifact would allow him to commune with the long dead scholars of the Xylonia people. The Xylonia's are long dead, but once held great knowledge and power over this region. 
 - The texts also speak of the fall of the great capital of the Xylonia's called Zha'thik and a great 'guardian' or 'god' or 'abomination' that has taken refuge in the fortress of the Zha'thik. These texts are basically a descriptive map to the "Iron Eye".
 - Lucian convinces Varren that he must go to retrieve this artifact, that it would allow them to learn many secrets of the ancient powers they possessed it. Varren agrees to send a small group of soldiers with Lucian to journey to Xylonia.
 - Xylonia is an old and mostly avoided region. The fall of the once might Xylonian people still echo's through many tales and is considered cursed. It is a region of hard mountains, deep crevasses and old tree growth. It will be a difficult journey.
- Lorn, the captain of the guard, picks his strongest 5 men and they embark into the unknown. Lucian leads them with details from a century's old manuscript. In the course of their travels, they encounter many beasts and difficult terrain, but they are strong of body and spirit and reach an ancient crumbling ruin - what must have been Zha'thik.
 - The party finds passages into the earth, deep under the ground and spend weeks mapping and exploring, again encountering many strange creatures and perils, but finally they journey into the heart of the underground labyrinth of Zha'thik.
 - Lucian can feel the pull, feel the power of the "Eye" now. No longer relying on the painstaking mapping process, Lucian leads by the draw of energy to the artifact. 
 - When the party eventually emerges into a large high ceilinged space, they can see the "Eye", suspended  above a great dais in the center of the chamber. They also see a horrific site: a monstrous entity from realms beyond our own, its grotesque form a mass of writhing, pulsing tendrils. The tentacled horror lunges, its gaping maw open wide, ready to consume whatever it can reach.
 - The soldiers are caught off-guard by the horror of this, and one of the guards is killed and devoured immediately, unable to comprehend the sight and sound of the entity. Lucian immediately draws his staff and casts offensive spell after spell against the horror, trying to weaken this unimaginable foe. The soldier strike with swords, and spears, and duck attacks, now fully awakened to the task at hand. 
 - Lucian finally finds the creature is weakened by magics sourced from the light side of the Arcane spectrum, the area he is least knowledgeable in, but its something. He fears it will not be enough, he is not powerful enough in these arts, but he must try, he must do something and maybe buy the soldiers the time needed to wear down this abomination.
 > - I have to roll to beat an 8... and I roll 2d6. I get a 5 and 6! I did even need our +1! I succeed and  gain 1 Resolve point back! 
 > 	- Success = Increase 1 Resolve. 
 > 	- Failure = Decrease 1 Resolve.
 - Lorn, fearing the worst outcome of the situation, seizes on a plan. None can come close to the horror due to its many tentacles flailing about. Lucian seems to be slowing it and weakening it a little through his magics, but it is not enough. He takes a spear, and finds a high perch and waits until it turns and leaps through the air targeting high on the back side of the creature. Using his momentum, strength and body weight, he drives the spear deep. The beast screeches and thrashes. Lorn holds onto the spear, but it snaps off and he is thrown forcefully from the writhing body into a pillar. 
 - The creature is now thrashing around , reaching with it tentacles for the broken spear and its back while the remaining soldiers hack at the creature; spear and sword thrust in over and over until it final stops twitching and is nothing but a blood ruin. 
 - Lucian walks over to check Lorn. He is still holding the broken spear end and quietly laughing. Lorn looks up at Lucian and says "I knew we could take it Lucian. I knew...." and he speaks no more.
 - Lucian closes the eyes of the Captain of the Guard and silently thanks him for his service.
 - Lucian returns with the remaining guards, sadder at the loss of Lorn, but confident with his new prize: The Iron Eye of the Blind God.
###### Year Thirty Two
> - I draw the Ace of Hearts. 
> - Diamonds are "Mundane Social" events
> - Aces are "Truth Cards" and apply +1 to all challenges of the same nature. These are needed for the end game "Lichdom Ritual"
> 	- A truth of this world that gives you power over death and places you above all other mortals, giving you a chance at immortality. 
> 		- Where do you find it?
> 			1. In the Book of Skelos, crumbling scrolls long buried in the shelves of the forbidden library and guarded by blind sages.
> 			2. Hieroglyphics on the broken walls of a half buried city under the desert sands. 
> 			3. Experiments described in the journal of a sorcerer with a similar quest to yours, now consumed by worms in a cursed necropolis.
> 		- What is it?
> 			1. Death is only another alchemical process that can be stopped with the proper research of the body and the right potions.
> 			2. A soul can be trapped in this world by offering other souls in return, preventing it from abandoning its mortal body when it stops functioning.
> 			3. Resurrection is possible, and it has been recorded in the sacred texts of forgotten religions. An undying body might be achievable by worshipping foul gods that demand abhorrent sacrifices.
> - I roll a 3 and a 2:
> 	- 3. Experiments described in the journal of a sorcerer with a similar quest to yours, now consumed by worms in a cursed necropolis.
> 	- 2. A soul can be trapped in this world by offering other souls in return, preventing it from abandoning its mortal body when it stops functioning.
- Lucian spend the next year studying the "Iron Eye of the Blind God". In another journal he has discovered, he found a way to activate its powers and commune with the dead scholars of Xylonia. 
- Unfortunately, communication is not as straight forward as Lucian had hoped. Not only did the Xylonian people speak a different language, they few Xylonian entities he can contact are secretive, distrustful and he suspects some bias against the living. He is not sure they know they are dead and that he is not, but there is some level of animosity in their interactions.
- Most of his discoveries have given him some means to manipulate others in social interactions, allowing him to steer conversations, attitudes and outcomes strongly in his favor. Varren is pleased with the results of Lucians work, but unfortunately this results in his presence being required in more court meetings.

###### Year Thirty Three
> - Next I draw the Queen of Clubs. 
> - Clubs are "Arcane Research" events
> - Queens are "Influence Cards"
> - Discarded when used for:
> 	- Provide a bonus of +2d6 to an Adversity challenge of the same nature.
> 	- Provide a bonus of +1d6 to an Adversity challenge of the other nature.
> 	- Pay the cost of Scheming/Scrying.
> - The card description follows:
> 	- Help from arcane powers is not readily available to most mortals, but you have the opportunity to buy their assistance or command them to give you aid by heinous sorcery, secret knowledge, or other means. After all, you are a true master of the arcane among mortals. 
> 		- • How do you encounter them? Do they come to you or do you seek them out?
> 		- • Why do they help you and what does it cost you? 
> 		- • Why can you only request their aid once? 
> 	- Which master of the arcane helps you?
> 		1. The spirit of Skelos, or an incorporeal simulacrum of his consciousness, emerges from fading scripture to give advice speaking in riddles. Only you can see him.
> 		2. A witch, daughter of a prince of hell, tells you about the secrets whispered to her by demons and malevolent spirits of the dark forest in which she lives.
> 		3. A wandering seer offers cryptic visions of the future at the cost of some of your happiest memories, which you will forget forever. Which memory do you give up and how does it change you for the worst?
- Lucian monthly meets with Seraphine Sunshard to inspect the border lands of Aranthia. They do this to make sure the blight is contained and no other ill effects are taking effect.
- Once, the encountered a witch on the borders. She lay dying, her life force fading away. Seraphine attempted to heal her with the magics she knew, but the witch was beyond her skills, soon to pass deaths door. 
- Lucian, recalling the spell 'Vitalis Requiem,' a powerful spell that binds the essence of life to the mortal coil, restoring vitality to even the most gravely injured individuals. The spell is risky, as it involves tapping into forces at the farthest edge darkness. Lucian decides to try using this on the witch, but he must wait until the moment of death to cast this.
- Lucian casts the spell, sensing great powers struggling to drag her to hell, but manages to breathe life back into the witch's body. She awakens, grateful for the intervention. 
- The witch says her name is Kaliandra, and explains that she is the daughter of a Prince of Hell, that her mother was used by a cult in a ceremony to capture the princess powers in an unholy ceremony. The demon ravaged her mother and Kaliandra was the result of this ritual.
- Her mother eventually escaped from the cult with her infant daughter before they could use her life forces in another ritual. Kaliandra's mother raised her in the woods, but the prince has been waiting for her death. He is angry and jealous to gain his powers back from her soul upon death. She now seeks to do good in the forest in the attempt to free herself from his influence and be released from his power to retake her.
- She has yet to find a way to free herself from the demons hold, but she hopes to do enough good in the world to tip the balance or find a solution to release her. The witch can see Lucian is a dark mage, with necromantic powers. She despises such magics but is grateful to Lucian for saving her from her horrific fate. She crafts Luciana a charm that contains a tiny sliver of her lifeforce. This is a sliver of the powers of hell that are contained within her, and will aid Lucian a single time should he need it.

###### Year Thirty Four
> - Next I draw the Three of Clubs. 
> - Clubs are "Arcane Research" events
> - Three's are "Narrative Event Cards"
> 	- No effect on game mechanics
> 	- Opportunities for world building and character developments
> 	- Resolve events and discard
> - The card has the following description:
> 	- You discover the remains of an ancient civilization; impossibly old and incredibly beautiful. They were masters of such wonders that it makes you question the worth of your own achievements. Silence besets the abandoned place; no doubt these fallen jade statues and sundered colorful temples were once witness to wondrous and horrifying events now lost to recorded history. Perhaps their fall is for the best.
> 		- What destroyed them and how long ago was it?
> 		- What remains of them now among the broken pieces of their ancient glory?
> 		- How did you discover the ruins and what were you looking for?
> 		- Where are the ruins and what problem did you have on the journey?
> 	- Who were they?
> 		1. A race that came to your world in the time before the Cataclysm to flee their demonic masters.
> 		2. A cruel culture that built Cyclopean monuments to their defunct emperors and practiced necromancy.
> 		3. A complex civilization that transcended their own organic bodies, animating complex machines with their spirits.
> 	- I roll a 1: A race that came to your world in the time before the Cataclysm to flee their demonic masters.

- Lucian finds hints of the "Ones Before" and goes on another expedition, like previously. All he has are some matching texts that give vague clues. Again they journey deep into some land and have to journey underground into some deep caverns. Here they find a marvel, a preserved city buried deep
- The things here are ancient, and Lucian fears that taking anything could be fraught with unknown powers and consequences. But they must take something back for Varren, to satisfy his thirst for powerful artifacts. They cannot return empty handed. But Lucian fears that even he cannot truly know what the effects of anything here. He is truly afraid. The "Ones Before" clearly possessed knowledge and abilities far surpassing our own, and Lucian fears we risk awakening forces we cannot control.
- Although the city's discovery is great and could yield great knowledge, Lucian settles on something relatively benign to appease Lord Varren: a large Jade Statue. The craftsmanship is unmatched and Lucian can detect no magical aura from it. This causes the return trip to take three times as long, but Varren is pleased by the trophy and the opportunity to mine the old kingdom for more wealth and knowledge. The statue is so extraordinary that it is placed at the entrance of the throne room so that anyone visiting will be awed by its wonder. 

###### Year Thirty Five
> - Next I draw the Nine of Clubs. 
> - Clubs are "Arcane Research" events
> - Cards Seven through Nine 's are "Adversity Event Cards"
> 	- Your research of forgotten arts takes you to create an alchemical concoction that attracts death. Yourself or someone close to you is gravely injured. 
> 	- The foul smell of the potion was a clear warning of danger, but no reward comes without risk and you had to try its effects. 
> 		- What was the most difficult ingredient to obtain and why?
> 		- Is this the first time you try? Why did you fail in the past?
> 	-  What were the expected effects?
> 		1. Opening your mind to the secrets whispered by the darkness and the elements.
> 		2. Channelling your powers in the chaotic planes.
> 		3. Rising the dead from their rotting sleep.
> 	- But instead...
> 		1. The potion transforms the subject into an aggressive monstrosity with only a faint resemblance of a human mind.
> 		2. The subject grows an insatiable hunger for human flesh that goes beyond any other desire.
> 		3. The subject phases out of existence for hours, returning with a broken mind and speaking in babbles.
> 	- I roll a 2 and a 1 for the results: 
> 		- What were the expected effects? > 2. Channelling your powers in the chaotic planes. 
> 		- But instead... > 1. The potion transforms the subject into an aggressive monstrosity with only a faint resemblance of a human mind.
> 	- I roll a 4 against the 9 and fail the Adversity Event. I opt to take the hit to Resolve for now.
- Lucian is approached to aid a sick member of House Varren. The only option is was to try an experimental spell and potion, but things went awry. The subject of the ill-fated experiment was young Edwin Vexar, the scion of the influential Vexar clan, sworn allies of House Varren. Born into privilege, Edwin was raised amidst the opulence of the Vexar estate, surrounded by the finest tutors and the most refined society. Yet despite his advantageous upbringing, Edwin proved himself to be intelligent and resourceful, possessing a keen mind for strategy and diplomacy. His untimely illness presented an opportunity for Lucian to showcase his skills as a scholar of the arcane arts, and was approached by this family to explore unconventional means of saving his life.
- The spell was correct, but the potion was not. The result was the transformation of Edwin into an aggressive monstrosity with only a faint resemblance to what he was, both mentally and physically. Edwin lashed out at me, wounding me, but the guards immediately killed the creature that was once Edwin. Thankfully Lucian performed this in my private chambers thus saving the family the horror of his final moments, and Lucian the humiliation of the failure in front of others. Lucian was deeply saddened by the loss of Edwin, he had great promise. 
- Thankfully there are no repercussions from this failure other than a slight lessening of Lucian's reputation. The Vexar family knew Edwin's condition was doomed without my attempt, to begin with, and had only sought Lucian out after all other treatments had failed. 
- Lucian's only solace was learning from his mistake, and he would carry the scar from the encounter for the rest of his life as a reminder

###### Year Thirty Six
> - Next I draw the Ten of Hearts. 
> - Clubs are "Mundane Social" events
> - Cards numbered Ten are "Plots and Curses"
> 	- Mundane Plots and Arcane Curses work against you, such as a conspiracy to end your life, or enemy petitions to responsive gods to halt your progress and thwart your ambitions. 
> 	- Keep the card visible on the table. The next time you have to roll a challenge of the same nature (Mundane or Arcane), apply a penalty of -2 and discard the card. The penalties of several Plot/Curse cards are cumulative over the next challenge. 
> 	- For instance:
> 		- Imagine I drew an Arcane Curse on a previous turn, so the card (10 of Clubs) is on the table in front of me until the moment I draw an Arcane Adversity challenge and the penalty has been applied. 
> 		- Let’s say the challenge difficulty is 7 and I have no other bonuses or penalties. Due to the Arcane Curse card, I must obtain a result of 7 or higher with 2d6 - 2 to succeed. Regardless of the result of this challenge, the Arcane Curse card is discarded after this Adversity event is resolved.
> - Next I draw the Six of Spades. 
> - Clubs are "Arcane Unnatural" events
> - Cards numbered Six are "Scheming/Scrying" cards
> 	- I discard the Previously drawn Six of Clubs as the cost
> 	- I roll a 5 and 2, drawing 7 cards. I end up with a King of Diamonds and a 4 of Diamonds as the Certain Future and shuffle the other cards into the deck, avoiding an Adversity event for now.
> - Next I draw the Four Of Diamonds:
> 	- Diamonds are "Mundane Violent" events
> 	- Four cards are "Narrative Events"
> 		- The bloodthirsty heir of an old ruling dynasty has come to power by treachery and murder, and you helped or failed to prevent it. Discontent spreads and revolution is imminent, but the iron fist of the new ruler keeps the population in check with ruthless practices and well paid mercenaries, while the coffers of the kingdom are wasted in bribes and steel.
> 			- Why did you help or oppose the change? Are you an associate of the new or old regime?
> 			- Why did you get involved? Do you owe any favours or made a deal for your own benefit?
> 			- How do you ensure the new rulers stay in power or how do you remove them from the throne? Do you face any consequences for it? 
> 		- Who is the new ruler?
> 			1. Salome, who took the throne from her sister with lies and tricks. She worships dreaded god and sacrifices citizens to its avatar.
> 			2. Yyrkoon, who had the support of other noble dynasties and declared the rightful ruler an outlaw. 
> 			3. Numedides, who had the support of a neighbouring kingdom and help from rare and ancient sorcery.
- Aranthia! Varrens neighbor's noble house that Lucian helped. Aranthia was still weak from the blight and Yyrkoon is some lesser heir and is taking advantage of this and attempting to take control. The other noble houses see this as a way to weaken Varren and Aranthia's alliance by putting someone more to their liking in control, someone they could influence! While the old lord (Torvan) is imprisoned and Yyrkoon assumes power, Seraphine secretly aids us in taking Yyrkoon and restoring Torvan to rule.
- Seraphine tells us all of Yyrkoon's strengths, where his troops are, etc and we crush Yyrkoon's armies and capture Yyrkoon - restoring Lord Torvan. Varren does this mostly out of wanting to maintain the power the relationship has brought and the fear of losing this. As a price for Varrens help, Lord Torvan is pushed to wed his daughter to Varren and combine the houses under Varren. Also, Yyrkoon is given to Lucian to do with as he pleases after a public trial.
