## WELCOME TO THE FORGEWELCOME TO THE FORGE

In Ironsworn: Starforged (hereafter referred to as Starforged), you are a  
spaceborne hero sworn to undertake perilous quests. You will explore  
uncharted space, unravel the secrets of a mysterious galaxy, and build  
bonds with those you meet on your travels. Most importantly, you will  
swear iron vows and see them fulfilled—no matter the cost.

To play Starforged, you make some decisions about the setting and your  
character, and set your story in motion. When you encounter something  
dangerous or uncertain, your choices and the dice determine the outcome.

BUILDING ON THE IRONSWORN LEGACY

Starforged is a standalone sequel to the Ironsworn tabletop roleplaying  
game. If you’re an experienced Ironsworn player, welcome back! You’ll  
find some changes and enhancements to suit the spaceborne setting,  
but the core of the game will be familiar. If you’re new to Ironsworn, this  
rulebook will give you everything you need to undertake quests in a  
perilous galaxy.

### Modes of Play

Starforged offers three ways to play:

```
✴ Guided: One or more players take the role of their characters, the
protagonists in your story, while another player is the guide. The
guide is sometimes referred to as a gamemaster or GM in other
roleplaying games. Instead of playing as one of the protagonists, the
guide helps bring the world to life, portrays the people and creatures
the protagonists encounter, and works with the other players to
decide the outcome of actions and events.
✴ Cooperative (Co-op): You and one or more friends play together to
overcome challenges and complete quests. A guide is not required.
The Starforged game system will help reveal the nature of locations,
characters, and situations you encounter.
✴ Solo: As with cooperative play, no guide is necessary. You portray a
lone heroic character, using the Starforged game system to explore
the dramatic story of your character and their fateful vows.
```

```

#### ABOUT KEY TERMS

Throughout this book, key terms will be shown in red when they are first  
introduced. If a key term is reintroduced in another important context, it  
will be shown in red again.

18 CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

### What You Need To Play

You’ll need some dice to play Starforged:

```
✴ Two ten-sided dice (d10) for each player. These are challenge dice.
✴ One six-sided die (d6) for each player. This is an action die.
✴ Optionally, another pair of ten-sided dice to use as oracle dice.
```

You’ll also need some print-and-play materials (available for download at  
ironswornrpg.com):

```
✴ One set of asset cards (also available for purchase as a preprinted
card deck).
✴ The Starforged Playkit, a set of reference sheets and worksheets.
```

Finally, you may want a journal or notebook to record your adventure log.

SCHEDULING YOUR STARFORGED SESSIONS

If you’re playing solo, a session can be as long as you like, from a few  
minutes to a few hours. If you’re playing with others, you probably want  
to dedicate enough time to make some progress in your quests; plan on a  
couple of hours or more.

### Tone and Inspiration

Starforged is human-centric science fiction on a perilous frontier. This is a  
scavenged future, with equipment often cobbled together from salvage.  
People cling to survival on inhospitable worlds and in remote space  
stations. Much has been forgotten or lost. It’s a dangerous life for anyone  
living on this frontier, and doubly so for the Ironsworn—those adventurers  
bound to sworn quests.

Inspiration comes from the quest-driven stories of The Mandalorian, the  
lived-in aesthetic and fantasy-infused trappings of the original Star Wars  
trilogy, the workaday exploits of Firefly, the isolated horror of Alien, the  
mysticism and faction politics of Dune, the retro-tech and desperation  
of Battlestar Galactica’s modern reboot, the cosmic mysteries and class  
struggles of The Expanse, and the gonzo adventures and fantastic  
locations of Guardians of the Galaxy.

You can bend the tone to your liking. You’ll make a unique version of the  
setting as you define aspects such as its history, technology, communities,  
lifeforms, supernatural abilities, and more.

WELCOME TO THE FORGE 19

### The Setting

Your adventures are set within the Forge. This is a globular cluster in  
orbit around your people’s home galaxy. It is 1,700 light years above the  
galactic plane—a bright island in a dark void.

Interstellar nebula span the depths of the Forge, interspersed with denser  
clouds of vibrant interplanetary dust and strange energies. It is a chaotic  
galaxy wracked by fiery stellar storms and unpredictable gravitational  
currents. The planets and stars of this place are born of that chaos.

Your people came to the Forge two centuries ago in the wake of a  
cataclysm in their home galaxy. Today, this new home offers opportunity  
and peril. Remnants of ancient civilizations hold dangerous knowledge  
and forbidden power. Your people build settlements on new worlds, but  
those places rarely offer a safe haven. Conflicts rage between people  
and factions. Pirates prowl the spaceways in search of easy prey. Baneful  
creatures and dark forces dwell on corrupted planets and in the abyssal  
void between stars.

REGIONS OF THE FORGE

Your people divide the Forge broadly into four regions:

```
✴ Terminus: Your people landed in this region following their exodus
from their home galaxy. Settlements are common here. Factions
compete for resources, and spaceborne caravans follow charted
paths among the stars. But the Forge is a vast galaxy; even here,
there are still unknown and isolated domains.
✴ Outlands: In the last few decades, your people have pushed deeper
into the galaxy, searching for habitable planets, resources, and
opportunities. Settlements within the Outlands are scattered, and
navigation paths are often uncharted.
✴ Expanse: A few bold pioneers have delved the far-flung reaches of
the Forge. Isolated settlements have been built among these distant
domains, but they are usually lost and disconnected from the settled
regions.
✴ Void: Beyond the Forge, there are only a few isolated stars and vast
gulfs of nothing. Travel beyond the periphery of the Forge is difficult
or impossible.

### Mechanics and the Fiction

Starforged is a game. It uses various mechanics, such as rolling dice and  
managing the resources on your character sheet. As a player, you often  
make decisions based on a desired mechanical outcome. For example,  
you might choose a particular action to get a bonus on your die roll. The  
basic mechanics of Starforged are introduced in this chapter.

Starforged is also heavily reliant on the fiction—the imagined narrative of  
characters, places, and situations within your game. You envision actions  
and events in a way that is consistent with the dramatic, fictional reality  
you have forged for your story and the setting.

HOW MECHANICS AND FICTION INTERACT

You start by picturing the situation. What is happening? What are you  
trying to do? How are you doing it? If you are playing solo, imagine it. If  
you are playing co-op, talk it out. If you are the guide, set the scene for  
your players and work with them to add or clarify details.

Then, if a protagonist faces uncertainty or danger, the mechanics help  
resolve the situation. You roll dice, check the result, and translate that  
outcome back to the fiction. How does the situation change? What  
happens next? In this way, the fiction bookends the mechanics.

You’ll learn how the mechanics work in this chapter, but keep in mind this  
balance between those mechanics and the fiction. Without mechanics,  
your story lacks choices, consequences and surprises. Without fiction, the  
game is an exercise in rolling dice. Playing Starforged relies on both the  
mechanics and the fiction, but leads and follows with the fiction.

### Iron Vows

For the people of the Forge, an iron vow is sacred. When you hold a  
piece of iron and declare your solemn promise to serve or aid someone,  
or to complete a personal quest, your honor is bound to that vow. Those  
who undertake these sworn quests are called Ironsworn. Abandoning or  
recanting an iron vow is the worst sort of failure.

Iron vows are the core of playing Starforged. It is your vows that drive you.  
These goals create the context for your adventures and challenges. As  
you complete vows, you gain experience and new abilities.

In the campaign launch exercises in the next chapter, you’ll have an  
opportunity to define the nature of iron vows in your setting.

WELCOME TO THE FORGEWELCOME TO THE FORGE 2323

### Your Character

You use a character sheet (shown on the opposite page, and available  
as part of the Starforged Playkit) to manage the main aspects of your  
character. This sheet includes components such as a momentum meter,  
condition meters, and impacts. We’ll cover these later in this chapter.

The character sheet also includes your stats. These are core to your  
character’s capabilities, nature, and approach. In the next chapter, you’ll  
create your character and assign each stat a value from 1 to 3. Then,  
when things get risky or uncertain, you roll dice and use one of your stats  
as a bonus.

The stats are:

```
✴ Edge: quickness, agility, and prowess when fighting at a distance.
✴ Heart: courage, willpower, empathy, sociability, and loyalty.
✴ Iron: physical strength, endurance, aggressiveness, and prowess
when fighting at close quarters.
✴ Shadow: sneakiness, deceptiveness, and cunning.
✴ Wits: expertise, knowledge, and observation.
```

Another key aspect of your character is your assets, an example of which  
is shown below. They are formatted as poker-sized cards. Assets provide  
abilities that can improve or modify your actions. They are acquired when  
you create your character and as you gain experience. In this rulebook,  
asset names are shown in ALL CAPS. You can learn more about assets  
on page 54.

```

```

```
[ When you Set a Course, choose one.
✴ Follow the fastest path: Take +2
momentum on a strong hit.
✴ Follow the safest path: Add +1

your discoveries legacy track.
] When you Secure an Advantage by charting
the way forward, Face Danger to find a path
around a hazard, or Gather Information
about a location by studying your charts,
add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.
] Once per expedition, when you or an ally

hit or miss, you may ignore that result, plot
an alternate path, and make it an automatic
strong hit.

Throughout play,  
you gain and lose  
momentum. You can  
use positive momentum  
to improve the result

added as a bonus  
when you take action.

### You are Ironsworn

Your character is not just an array of mechanical bits and bobs. They are  
a person, grounded in the fiction of your setting. They have hopes and  
fears, virtues and failings. In the exercises in the next chapter, you’ll create  
your character and define their nature and background. For now, here are  
some default assumptions:

```
✴ You are driven: Many live out their lives barely venturing beyond
the shelter of their orbital station or planetside outpost, but you are
different. Your sworn vows lead to a life of danger, heroism, and
sacrifice at the edge of known space—and beyond.
✴ You are a spacer: For most, space is lonely, cold, incomprehensibly
vast, and full of peril. For you—at least for now—it is home. You have
a starship, and the depths of this largely uncharted galaxy call to you.
✴ You are competent: You might specialize in a particular career or set
of skills, but you are broadly self-reliant and capable.
✴ You are imperfect: You are not without your limitations. You’ll
make bad decisions. You will fail. Fate will conspire against you.
Overcoming those hardships, pushing on, is what makes you heroic.
✴ You are unbound: The default setting is human-centric, and
Starforged does not include specific options to play aliens, robots,
or other non-human science fiction archetypes. Aside from that
consideration, envision your character as you like. There are no
gameplay or setting restrictions that constrain your character’s race,
culture, disabilities, sexual orientation, or gender identity.
```

### Other Characters

The mechanics and fiction of Starforged are almost entirely focused on  
the actions and intent of your character. But you are not alone in the  
Forge; there are other characters who will take a role in your story.

```
✴ If you are playing a co-op or guided game with other players, their
characters are referred to in these rules as your allies.
✴ A companion is a special type of asset. They are a person, creature,
or robotic helper who accompanies you on your adventures.
✴ NPCs (non-player characters and creatures) are the other characters
who inhabit your universe. They can have a single mechanical attribute,
their rank, to help set their relative scale and abilities. But you do not
roll dice for them. When you attempt to influence them, oppose them,
or aid them, take action from your character’s perspective.
✴ As you explore the Forge and undertake quests, you establish deeper
relationships with NPCs—called connections—who become a more
vital part of your campaign.
```

## MAKING MOVESMAKING MOVES

Moves are self-contained systems to resolve an action, scene, or question.  
There are moves to cover most uncertain or risky situations you encounter  
in Starforged. Moves are centered on the players and protagonists. Other  
characters do not make moves.

```
When a move’s name is referenced within
these rules or by another move, you’ll see
it as underlined text. If you are reading
the Starforged rulebook on a digital
device, clicking underlined text will take
you to the full summary for that move.
```

```
This is the
move’s name.
```

This is the move’s trigger.  
Triggers are phrased as  
“when you [blank].” When  
you do that thing, or  
encounter that situation,  
make the move.

```
Moves requiring an
action roll (page 32)
will tell you what stat to
add to your roll, and may
give you an option to
include other bonuses.
```

Moves with an  
action roll include  
three levels of  
possible results: a  
strong hit, a weak  
hit, and a miss.

```
SWEAR AN IRON VOW
When you swear upon iron to complete
a quest, write your vow and give it a rank.
Then, roll +heart. If you swear this vow to a
connection, add +1; if you share a bond, add +2.
On a strong hit, you are emboldened and
it is clear what you must do next. Take +2
momentum.
On a weak hit, you are determined but begin
your quest with more questions than answers.
Take +1 momentum, and envision what you do
to find a path forward.
On a miss, you must overcome a significant
obstacle before you begin your quest. Envision
what stands in your way.
```

28 CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

### Moves and Dice

Most moves are based on risky actions from the perspective of your  
character. You duck behind cover in a gunfight, fly your starship through  
a dense asteroid field, or give medical care to an ally. These moves use  
dice to determine the outcome. This is called an action roll (page 32).

A few moves measure your headway against an extended challenge, such  
as an expedition or fight, using a progress track (page 39). These are  
called progress moves. When you are ready to resolve a challenge, you  
make a progress roll.

Other moves utilize a different kind of dice roll, called an oracle roll (page  
60 ). These moves help determine the outcome of uncertain events out  
of your character’s control.

Some moves don’t require a roll. They might complement or reference  
a separate move, help you manage your character and their challenges,  
or support you in managing a session. Don’t roll dice unless a move tells  
you to.

We’ll cover all the basic dice rolling mechanics starting on page 32.

### Referencing Moves

Starforged moves are based on the structure created by D. Vincent Baker  
and Meguey Baker in their Apocalypse World roleplaying game. If you’re  
familiar with Apocalypse World, or other games using that framework  
(called Powered by the Apocalypse), you might be surprised by the  
relatively large number of moves in Starforged.

Don’t be intimidated. You are not expected to memorize Starforged moves.  
After playing the game for a bit, you’ll start to become familiar with their  
organization and triggers. They are categorized by activities, which means  
you tend to focus on a subset of moves for a particular scene. When more  
than one move seems to apply, use the one most specific to the situation.

Once you understand the basics of rolling dice and managing your  
character’s resources—as detailed in this chapter—the options and  
outcomes within moves help create a perilous, propulsive story.

MAKING MOVES 29

### Making Group Moves

When you are adventuring with allies—protagonists portrayed by other  
players—one of you often makes moves to resolve a challenge for the  
group. This represents that character taking the lead in a particular scene.

```
You are at the helm of your starship as you Undertake an Expedition
across a sector riddled with violent and unpredictable stellar
storms. Your allies put their faith in your talents as a pilot, and you
take the lead for this segment of the journey. You make the move
```

## THE ACTION ROLL

Unless a move specifically offers benefits for your allies, any mechanical  
bonus you gain from a move is applied only to the character making the  
move. For example, if you represent your group as you Swear an Iron Vow  
and score a strong hit, you take the mechanical reward (per the move,  
“take +2 momentum”). Everyone else benefits from the narrative success.  
The exception are moves such as Sojourn with specific options for your  
allies to take their own benefits.

When you make a move for the group, allies can contribute to your action  
by making the Aid Your Ally move. If they are successful, you gain a bonus  
you can leverage to improve your own chance of success. If more than  
one ally makes this move, bonuses can be stacked. However, keep in  
mind that moves are inherently risky, and multiple moves will dramatically  
increase the chance of failure.

When you make a move for your group and face a negative outcome, you  
should apply mechanical and narrative costs to an individual or the group  
in a way that best fits the current situation.

30 CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

### Best Practices for Moves

#### NOT EVERYTHING IS A MOVE

Don’t let your session jump from move to move without any roleplay,  
worldbuilding, or storytelling in between. If you’re doing something safe  
and certain, it’s not a move. If you want to gloss over something, do it.

Many moves offer potential benefits and costs, and it’s ultimately your  
decision whether to risk the move to gain the reward. If you happen across  
a planetside settlement in your travels and decide to roleplay some low-  
key interactions with friendly locals, that’s not a move. However, if you are  
wounded and your ship is badly damaged, making the Sojourn move at  
that settlement gives you an opportunity to recover.

MAKING MOVES MATTER

Let your moves flow organically out of your story. Don’t make moves  
purely for a mechanical benefit without some support in the fiction. Don’t  
repeat a move trying to get your desired outcome. A move, hit or miss,  
should always result in a change to the current situation.

```
You are trying to convince a faction leader to agree to an alliance.
You roleplay how you attempt to reason with them. Then, you
make the Compel move and fail. They refused. Why? What do you
learn or what do they do to make your situation more complex or
dangerous? Whatever happens, something happens. You can’t
Compel them again without new leverage or a different approach.
```

However, there will be times when you make a move multiple times in  
sequence. In combat, you might attack or defend with consecutive actions.  
When you are traveling on a long journey, you might roll several times to  
make progress on the expedition. That’s fine as long as the moves don’t  
get too mechanical. Break up the flow of play with other actions and  
narrative beats. When in doubt, follow this guideline: If you’ve made the  
same move three times in a row, switch things up.

MANAGING NEGATIVE OUTCOMES

Moves can represent escalating danger. A failure on one move might  
result in a minor complication or hardship, while leading the character  
into more perilous circumstances. The outcome of additional failures can  
progressively worsen to show control slipping out of the character’s grasp.

Some moves will make this explicit by giving you a specific bad outcome.  
Otherwise, ratcheting up the severity of failure is a technique to create  
increasing tension and danger. Whether you are playing a character or  
moderating the game as the guide, this is a valuable tool to manage the  
intensity of the story.

MAKING MOVES 31

## THE THE ACTION ROLLACTION ROLL

The action roll is the  
most common test you’ll  
make for your character.  
When you make a move  
triggered by a risky or  
uncertain action, roll  
these three dice at once  
to see what happens.

After rolling, add a stat to your action die. The move will tell you what  
stat to add (phrased as “roll +stat”), or may give you a choice. Some  
moves will tell you to use one of your condition meters, such as  
health or supply, in place of a stat. You may also have an opportunity  
to apply one or more bonuses called adds (phrased as “add +X”).

The total of your action die, your stat, and any adds is your action score.  
The action score is never greater than 10—anything over that is ignored.

To determine the outcome of your move, check if the action score beats  
the individual values of the challenge dice.

There are three possible outcomes for the action roll.

```
Strong Hit: Your action score beats the value of both
challenge dice. You succeed at what you are trying to do.
```

```
Weak Hit: Your action score beats only one of the
challenge dice. You succeed, but with a cost or lesser effect.
```

```
Miss: Your action score doesn’t beat either challenge die.
You fail, or must make serious concessions.

32 CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

### Resolving the Outcome

Based on your result (strong hit, weak hit, or miss), the move will tell you  
how to interpret the outcome of your action. It might also offer you a  
choice. The result may include mechanical changes to your character’s  
status and narrative changes to the current situation.

Then, envision how the overall situation has changed.

```
✴ A strong hit means you are in control. You are driving the narrative
and taking proactive actions. What do you do next?
✴ A weak hit means the situation is slipping out of your control.
Instead of acting, you react. How do you respond?
✴ A miss means you have lost control of the situation. You encounter
hardships, new dangers, or increasing risk. What happens next?
```

Remember: Your action score needs to beat—not equal—the challenge  
dice to count as a hit. Ties go to the challenge dice. Since your action  
score can’t exceed 10, this means you never beat a 10 on a challenge die.

### Paying the Price

When you score a miss on a move, you’ll usually see a prompt to Pay the  
Price. This is a special move that lets you pick a likely negative outcome,  
roll on a table to see what happens, or use some other random prompt.

If you are the guide, you can consult with the Pay the Price move and tell  
the player the price as appropriate to the situation. Or just ask them to  
name their own price.

The main thing to remember when you must Pay the Price: Something  
happens. The situation gets more complex, dramatic, or dangerous.  
This can mean a narrative consequence that complicates things for your  
character, or a combination of a narrative and mechanical cost. Depending  
on the situation, the negative outcome might be framed as a result of an  
error or misstep, or as an external event you had no control over.

Be mindful of pacing. Don’t drop the hammer on your character after one  
bad action roll. Start with lesser consequences appropriate to the situation,  
and apply escalating danger and hardships if the failures stack up.

THE ACTION ROLL 33

### Rolling Matches

When you make an action roll, check the  
value of the challenge dice. If they are the  
same, you’ve rolled a match.

Some moves and assets offer specific outcomes for rolling a match. For  
example, if you Explore a Waypoint and roll a strong hit with a match,  
you can Make a Discovery as your character happens upon something  
wondrous. The match makes the outcome of your action more dramatic.

If your move and assets don’t provide a specific result for a match, you  
can still use it as a prompt to make something interesting happen. In solo  
and co-op modes, a match is your trigger to add a twist, create a new  
complication, introduce a new peril, or otherwise mix things up. If you’re  
playing as the guide, a match on the challenge dice can be your cue to  
introduce a surprising turn of events for the players.

You can let the outcome of an action influence the nature of a match.

```
Strong hit: The match should represent a twist in the
narrative, something interesting, or a new opportunity.
Miss: The match should represent a heightened negative
outcome, a complication, or new peril. Things get worse in
an unexpected way.
```

You can also let the intensity of the success or failure frame how you  
interpret a match. Rolling matched 10’s on your challenge dice should  
prompt you to introduce a harrowing turn of events or a dire failure. It’s as  
bad as things get.

**Not sure what a match means for the current situation? You can Not sure what a match means for the current situation? You can Ask the Ask the**

### The Guide and the Dice

If you are playing as the guide, you focus on moderating the session and  
responding to your player’s questions and actions. Since NPCs don’t make  
moves, you won’t need to make action rolls. However, you might want to  
have a pair of D10s available for oracle rolls.

34 CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

## MOMENTUMMOMENTUM

Momentum is a special mechanic that is central  
to playing Starforged. Your momentum value  
ranges from a -6 to +10 and represents your  
inertia, luck, and confidence. Move results and  
asset abilities may prompt you to increase or  
decrease momentum.

Mechanically, high momentum gives you a chance  
to overcome the whims of fate and improve your  
result on an action roll. In the fiction, momentum  
helps portray whether your character is surging  
forward, or if the tide has turned against you.

The momentum meter is on the left side of your  
character sheet. You can use a paper clip or  
token to mark the current value.

### Gaining Momentum

You can gain momentum as an outcome or option  
when making moves. This represents securing  
advantages, acquiring new insight, and making  
progress in your quests. If a move tells you to add  
momentum—phrased as “take +X momentum”—  
increase your momentum meter by that amount.  
The choices you make in a move, or the assets  
you use to support the move, may modify the  
value of the momentum gain.

In general, taking +1 momentum represents a  
minor advantage. Taking +2 momentum (or more)  
represents a major advantage.

### Losing Momentum

When you suffer a cost that causes a delay or puts  
you at a disadvantage, make the Lose Momentum  
move. Using this move, as appropriate to the  
severity of the situation, reduce your momentum  
by -1, -2, or -3.

Some moves or assets will prompt you to Lose  
Momentum as part of an outcome for an action,  
and may specify an amount of momentum  
to suffer, phrased as “Lose Momentum (-X).”  
You might also choose to Lose Momentum as a  
cost when you Pay the Price.

MOMENTUM 35

### Burning Momentum

Burning momentum is a powerful option to build on your success and  
deliver a decisive result or avoid dire failure. When you have positive  
momentum, after you make an action roll, you may replace your action  
score with your current momentum value to improve your result.

For example, your momentum meter is at +7 and your action score is 4.  
You roll a 5 and an 9 on your challenge dice. This would normally be a  
miss, but you can burn momentum to make your action score 7 instead of

4. This shifts your result from a miss to a weak hit.

Burning momentum is never required. Even if you score a miss on a move  
and have enough momentum to beat the challenge dice, you can choose  
to suffer the failure and save your momentum for a more crucial moment.

After you burn momentum, you must reset your momentum. See the  
next page for how that works.

36 CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

### Resetting Momentum

After you burn momentum, you must immediately  
adjust your momentum meter to your momentum  
reset value.

The default reset is +2. This value is reduced  
when you suffer from an impact (page 50).  
Impacts are statuses such as wounded or  
traumatized. Certain moves will prompt you to  
mark an impact on your character sheet.

```
✴ If you have one impact marked, your
momentum reset is +1.
✴ If you have more than one impact marked,
your momentum reset is 0.
```

There is a box below the momentum meter  
to record your current momentum reset. This  
may rise and fall through the course of a single  
session, but some impacts are lasting and will  
permanently alter your reset value.

After you reset your momentum, resolve the  
move. If the move or an asset provides a  
momentum bonus as a reward for the move  
outcome (phrased as “take +X momentum”),  
adjust the meter appropriately.

```
You Face Danger to hack a locked door, score
a miss, and burn momentum to improve the
result to a strong hit. Your momentum reset
is +2, so you adjust your momentum meter to
that value. Then, you resolve the outcome of
the move. Since a strong hit on Face Danger
prompts you to “take +1 momentum”, you
raise your momentum meter from +2 to +3.
```

### Max Momentum

Your max momentum starts at +10. This maximum is reduced by 1 for each  
marked impact. For example, one impact will drop your max momentum  
to +9. Three impacts will reduce it to +7.

There’s a spot on your character sheet below the momentum meter to  
record your current max momentum value.

You can’t increase momentum over your max. If you are at your max and a  
move or asset gives you an option to increase your momentum, you can’t  
take advantage of that benefit.

MOMENTUM 37

### Suffering Negative Momentum

When your momentum is negative (less than 0), and it matches the  
number rolled on your action die, you must suffer negative momentum.  
Your action die is canceled for the purposes of tallying your action score.  
You still check the success of your move by comparing your stat plus any  
adds to the challenge dice, but you won’t have your action die to help you.

For example, your momentum is -4, and you roll a 4 on your action die. The  
action die is canceled and not included in the tally for the action score,  
leaving only the stat and adds.

To make matters worse, if your action die is canceled, you can’t take  
a bonus from an asset ability triggered by that die. For example,  
if an ability is enabled by a prompt such as “If you roll a 6 on your  
action die,” you won’t gain that benefit of the canceled die. But if  
an asset forces a penalty for a specific action die value, such as  
stopping an ongoing power when you roll a 1, that outcome stands.  
In other words, nothing good comes of suffering negative momentum.

You only suffer negative momentum when the number on the action die  
matches the negative momentum value. Otherwise, it has no effect.

### Minimum Momentum

Your momentum cannot drop lower than -6. If you must Lose Momentum,  
and your momentum is already at its minimum, the Lose Momentum move  
will prompt you to apply the cost in some other way. This might include  
reducing a condition meter (such as health, spirit, or supply), or suffering a  
setback in a quest or other challenge.

### Tracking Momentum Between Sessions

Momentum is not reset between sessions. When you are finished playing,  
record your current momentum value. When you return to Starforged,  
begin play again with your momentum meter set to that value.

This also applies to the other meters on your character sheet, such as  
your condition meters (page 47). You are putting your story on pause,  
and will return to your character in the same state you left them—for  
better or worse.

38 CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

## PROGRESS TRACKSPROGRESS TRACKS

A progress track measures your headway against a goal or obstacle,  
and is used to resolve whether you ultimately succeed or fail against  
that challenge.

```
✴ When you Swear an Iron Vow, a progress track represents the
challenges you overcome on your way to achieving your goal.
✴ When you Undertake an Expedition, a progress track represents how
favorable the journey has been.
✴ When you Make a Connection, a progress track represents the
evolution of the relationship.
✴ When you Enter the Fray, a progress track represents your advantage
as you attempt to achieve your objective.
```

Progress tracks are drawn as a row of ten boxes that you fill in—or mark—  
as you advance toward your goal. When you initiate a challenge, these  
boxes are empty.

### Challenge Ranks

When you create a progress track, give the challenge a rank. In increasing  
order of severity, the ranks are troublesome, dangerous, formidable,  
extreme, and epic.

Ranks help gauge the difficulty of a challenge. More importantly, they are  
a measure of its complexity. Higher ranked challenges will require more  
focus, more steps to complete, and more time—both in the imagined  
world and at the table. Troublesome is used for simple challenges.  
Dangerous is a typical challenge. Formidable is an intimidating challenge.  
Epic and extreme challenges require great effort and luck to overcome.

Important NPCs can be given a rank to help gauge their relative scale,  
power, and abilities. If you are undertaking a quest to defeat an NPC,  
facing an NPC in a fight, or establishing an NPC as a connection, their  
rank is considered along with the other aspects of the situation and goal.

When choosing a challenge rank, you should also consider how well your  
character is positioned. If circumstances give you an unusual advantage  
or disadvantage, nudge the rank up or down appropriately. For example,  
if you Enter the Fray weaponless and facing armed foes, you would raise  
the rank of your objective to reflect that disparity. If you secure the aid of a  
local scout before you Undertake an Expedition, you could lower the rank  
of the journey to represent their help.

PROGRESS TRACKS 39

### Marking Progress

Once you initiate a progress track, you make specific moves to advance  
toward that goal. These moves reward you with an opportunity to mark  
progress on the progress track for that challenge. For example, as you  
achieve victories on your path to fulfilling a vow, you Reach a Milestone  
and mark progress.

```
REACH A MILESTONE
When you make headway in your quest by doing any of the
following...
✴ overcoming a critical obstacle
✴ gaining meaningful insight
✴ completing a perilous expedition
✴ acquiring a crucial item or resource
✴ earning vital support
✴ defeating a notable foe
...you may mark progress per the rank of the vow.
```

Similarly, you mark progress on a journey when you Undertake an  
Expedition and reach a waypoint. For a connection, you mark progress  
as you Develop Your Relationship. In a fight, you make moves such as  
Strike or Gain Ground to mark progress against your objectives. These  
incremental moves let you amass advantages to have the best chance of  
success when you are ready to resolve the challenge.

Asset abilities may also offer an opportunity to mark progress on a  
challenge. For example, if you are a BRAWLER and Enter the Fray  
positioned in close quarters against your foe, you have the chance to  
immediately mark progress on an objective in that fight.

HOW TO MARK PROGRESS

Each box in a progress track is filled with lines called ticks. A full box  
consists of four ticks in a star-shaped pattern. When a move or asset  
ability prompts you to mark progress, check the rank of the challenge and  
fill in the appropriate number of boxes or ticks per the illustration below.  
The boxes in a track are filled progressively from left to right.

```
Troublesome
3 boxes
```

```
Dangerous
2 boxes
```

```
Formidable
1 box
```

```
Extreme
2 ticks
```

```
Epic
1 tick
```

40 CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

### Stacking Progress

If a move prompts you to mark progress, and you have an asset ability that  
also instructs you to mark progress for that action, you may mark progress  
again. In other words, “mark progress” stacks. Every instance of progress  
earned within the same action allows you to mark the appropriate number  
of boxes or ticks per the rank of the challenge.

```
You Undertake an Expedition across the wind-blasted terrain of
the desert planet Sirocco. You have given the expedition a rank of
dangerous, and are riding your HOVERBIKE support vehicle asset.
```

```
You make the move for the first segment of the expedition, and roll
a strong hit with a match. Per the Undertake an Expedition move,
you mark progress on a strong hit. Your HOVERBIKE also has an
ability that prompts you to mark progress when you score a strong
hit with a match on an expedition. Between the move and the asset,
that’s two instances of “mark progress” for this action.
```

```
When you mark progress against a dangerous challenge, you
normally mark 2 boxes. Since you can mark progress twice for this
action, you mark 4 boxes total. Your trusty HOVERBIKE has sped
you along on this expedition.
```

In addition, if a move or asset prompts you to “mark progress twice,” do  
so. For example, when you Strike and score a hit, you may mark progress  
twice against your objective for that fight. Any additional instances of “mark  
progress” gained through an asset ability stack on top of that reward.

### Managing Progress Tracks

Your character sheet includes a progress track for your background vow,  
which is an epic vow you define when you create your character.

You can create and mark other progress tracks in your journal, on  
notepaper, or using the worksheets available within the Starforged  
Playkit. Some progress tracks—such as a combat track or low-ranked  
expedition track—might only be needed to resolve a scene or two. But  
most progress tracks will persist across sessions. For example, if you have  
a high-ranked connection you visit infrequently, their progress track may  
remain incomplete for the bulk of your campaign.

If you are playing Starforged with a digital tool, progress tracks are likely  
built into the interface. Or use whatever approach works for you to emulate  
boxes and ticks.

PROGRESS TRACKS 41

### Progress Moves

There are several key moves, called progress moves, which utilize  
progress tracks to resolve the outcome of challenges. For example, to  
see how you fare when you seize an objective in a fight, make the Take  
Decisive Action progress move.

This label  
identifies a  
move as a  
progress move.

A progress  
move uses a  
progress roll  
instead of an  
action roll. See  
the next page  
for how it works.

```
TAKE DECISIVE ACTION
Progress Move
When you seize an objective in a fight, envision
how you take decisive action. Then, roll the
challenge dice and compare to your progress.
If you are in control, check the result as normal. If
you are in a bad spot, count a strong hit as a weak
hit, and a weak hit as a miss.
On a strong hit, you prevail. Take +1 momentum. If
any objectives remain and the fight continues, you
are in control.
On a weak hit, you achieve your objective, but not
without cost. Roll on the table below or choose
one. If the fight continues, you are in a bad spot.
```

```
1–40 It’s worse than you thought: Make a
suffer move (-2)
41–52 Victory is short-lived: A new peril or foe
appears
53–64 You face collateral damage: Something
is lost, damaged, or broken
65–76 Others pay the price: Someone else
suffers the cost
77–88 Others won’t forget: You are marked
for vengeance
89–100It gets complicated: The true nature of
a foe or objective is revealed
```

```
On a miss, you are defeated or your objective is
lost. Pay the Price.
```

42 CHAPTER 1: THE BASICSCHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

### Progress Rolls

You don’t make an action roll when making a progress move. Instead,  
tally the number of fully filled progress boxes (those with four ticks). This  
is your progress score. Then, roll only the challenge dice and compare  
your progress score to the value of the dice. This is called a progress roll.

Important: It’s not necessary to fill your progress track before making your  
progress move. When deciding whether to make a progress move, you  
need to weigh the chance of success against the risk of continuing to  
make preparatory moves.

As with an action roll, if your progress score beats the challenge dice, it’s a  
strong hit. If you beat one of the challenge dice, it’s a weak hit. If you fail to  
beat either die, it’s a miss. The progress move will tell you how to resolve  
the challenge based on the outcome of your roll.

In the example below, compare your progress score of 5 to your challenge  
dice when making the progress move. The sixth progress box is only  
partially filled in, and doesn’t count toward the progress score.

#### MOMENTUM AND PROGRESS ROLLS

Momentum is ignored when you make a progress move. You cannot burn  
momentum on a progress roll, and you do not suffer negative momentum.

### Sharing Progress Tracks With Allies

When you and your allies are working together to resolve a challenge—a  
quest, expedition, connection, or fight—you share a progress track. This  
is called a shared challenge. When a move prompts someone to mark  
progress for that challenge, it is marked on your shared progress track.

When you make a progress move for a shared challenge, only one of you  
rolls the dice. The result will stand for the group.

If you are successful as you make a progress move to Fulfill Your Vow,  
Forge a Bond, or Finish an Expedition, anyone who was part of the shared  
challenge earns the legacy reward and marks the appropriate legacy  
track. See the next page for how that works.

PROGRESS TRACKS 43

## LEGACY TRACKSLEGACY TRACKS

```
Legacy tracks are a special type of progress track to show the evolution
of your character. There are three legacy tracks on your character
sheet: quests, bonds, and discoveries. When you begin play with a new
character, these tracks are empty.
```

```
As you complete quests, form bonds, and make discoveries, you advance
along these tracks by marking ticks and filling boxes. For each filled box,
you gain experience to spend on new assets or asset upgrades.
Legacy tracks are also an abstract representation of your victories, the
network of people you rely on, your understanding of the perils of the
Forge, and the funds and resources you can bring to bear. As you advance
along the tracks, envision how your character’s reputation grows.

### Marking Legacy Rewards

In recognition of notable achievements, moves and  
asset abilities will prompt you to mark ticks or fill boxes  
in one or more of your legacy tracks. This is called a  
legacy reward. For example, if you Make a Discovery,  
you earn two ticks on your discoveries legacy track.

Legacy tracks are not given a rank, but are otherwise  
treated the same as a standard progress track. It takes  
four ticks to fill a box.

### Gaining Experience

When you fill a legacy track box, make the Earn  
Experience move for some well-earned rewards. Per  
that move, take 2 experience for each newly filled  
legacy box.

The two small experience counters attached to legacy  
track boxes each represent 1 earned experience. When  
you fill a legacy track box and Earn Experience, that  
experience is ready to spend.

### Spending Experience

You spend earned experience to gain or upgrade  
assets, including new modules for your ship, support  
vehicles, companions, paths, and deeds. These assets  
add new options for your character and bolster your  
actions in specific circumstances.

Per the Advance move, it costs 2 experience to  
upgrade an existing asset, and 3 experience to buy a  
new asset.

Once you spend experience, make a mark to fill in the  
experience counters. Each filled counter represents 1  
spent experience.

See page 54 to learn more about assets.

```
Fill the legacy track boxes completely from left Fill the legacy track boxes completely from left
to right. If you have a partially filled box and are to right. If you have a partially filled box and are
given a legacy reward that prompts you to fill given a legacy reward that prompts you to fill
one or more boxes, convert the reward to ticks. one or more boxes, convert the reward to ticks.
For example, 2 boxes is 8 ticks. Then, fill the For example, 2 boxes is 8 ticks. Then, fill the
incomplete box first. incomplete box first.
```

LEGACY TRACKS 45

### Rolling Against a Legacy Track

If a move prompts you to make a test against  
a legacy track, treat it as a standard progress  
roll (page 43). Tally the number of filled  
boxes on the track for your progress score,  
roll your challenge dice, and compare the  
progress score to the challenge dice. As with  
a progress roll, momentum is ignored.

### Clearing a Legacy Track

When you fill all ten boxes on a legacy track,  
you are not necessarily at the end of that  
path for your character.

As noted in the Earn Experience move, if  
your life of adventure and peril continues  
after filling a legacy track, you may erase  
all filled boxes and experience counters,  
and resume marking legacy rewards in the  
now-empty track.

When you clear the track, mark the “10”  
bubble in the top right corner. This is your  
reminder to treat the value of the track as 10  
if you make a progress roll against it.

EARNING EXPERIENCE ON A  
CLEARED TRACK

Because a cleared legacy track represents  
a character nearing the height of their  
potential, you gain experience at a slower  
rate on that track. Take 1 experience for each  
filled legacy track box instead of 2.

### Continuing a Legacy

When your character’s time as Ironsworn is  
done—whether through retirement or more  
dire circumstances—you may pass on your  
legacy to a new character using the Continue  
a Legacy move. Through this move, you roll  
against each of the legacy tracks to see  
how your achievements and struggles echo  
through time.

```
Along the right side of your character
sheet are three condition meters:
health, spirit, and supply. These
measure your character’s readiness
and status. As with the momentum
meter, you can use a paperclip or
token to mark the current values.
These meters may rise and fall
throughout a typical session. Their
values are reduced when you face
hardship through a suffer move (page
198 ), and increased when you make
recover moves (page 208).
```

### HEALTH

```
Health represents your current
physical condition and stamina,
ranked from 0 to 5. Health is reduced
when you Endure Harm, and increased
when you rest or receive care through
moves such as Heal.
If you are at 0 health, scoring a miss
when you Endure Harm puts you at
risk of suffering an impact (page 50)
or dying.
```

### SPIRIT

```
Spirit is your current morale and
mental state, ranked from 0 to 5. Spirit
is reduced when you Endure Stress. It
is increased when you find comfort in
companionship or relaxed moments
through moves such as Hearten.
If you are at 0 spirit, scoring a miss
when you Endure Stress puts you at
risk of suffering an impact or falling
into desolation.
```

## CONDITION METERSCONDITION METERS

```
CONDITION METERS 47
```

### Supply

Supply represents your preparedness, including food, water, fuel,  
weapons, ammo, equipment, cargo, money, and general upkeep.

Supply is ranked from 0 to 5. It is decreased when you make the Sacrifice  
Resources move, and is increased when you Resupply to fortify your  
provisions and readiness.

If you need to know if you have a specific item or resource at hand, make  
the Check Your Gear move. When you Sacrifice Resources and your  
supply falls to 0, you must mark unprepared (page 50).

SUPPLY AND ALLIES

If you are playing with others, the supply meter represents the shared  
resources among your party. You and your allies use the same supply  
value while you travel together. If any of you make a move to increase  
supply, or suffer the result of an outcome that forces you to Sacrifice  
Resources, each of you adjust your supply meter accordingly. If anyone  
must mark unprepared, everyone marks unprepared.

48 CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

### Asset Condition Meters

```
Several assets have their own condition meters.
✴ Your STARSHIP and other
vehicles have an integrity
meter (seen here at the
bottom of this asset card)
to measure their condition.
When your vehicle faces a
damaging situation, make
the Withstand Damage
move. To get a vehicle
back up to speed, make
the Repair move.
✴ Companion assets have
a health meter that is
reduced when you make
the Companion Takes a
Hit move. Their health is
increased through the Heal
move when you treat them
or obtain treatment—or
using the Repair move for
mechanical companions.
✴ Some assets have a unique condition meter for a specialized
resource. For example, if you are a FIREBRAND, you have a fire
meter and tap into that inner source to unleash destructive energies.
To track the value of a condition meter on an asset card, make a mark,
or use a paperclip or token. You can also set a six-sided die on top of the
card and rotate it to show the current value. The value of a meter cannot
exceed the maximum shown on the card.
Learn more about assets starting on page 54.
```

### Action Rolls and Condition Meters

```
Some moves prompt you to make an action roll using the value of a
condition meter instead of a stat. For example, when you Check Your
Gear, the move tells you to “roll +supply.” When you see an action framed
as “roll +[condition meter],” use the value of that meter in your action roll
as if it were a stat.
Some assets allow you to use the value of a condition meter as an add
for your action roll, phrased as “add +[condition meter].” This is a boost to
your action score in addition to your stat, rather than a replacement for
the stat.
To learn more about game terms, see the glossary on page 388.
```

```
COMMAND VEHICLE
STARSHIP
```

```
[ Your armed, multipurpose starship is suited
for interstellar and atmospheric flight. It can
comfortably transport several people, has
space for cargo, and can carry and launch
support vehicles. When you Advance, you
may spend experience to equip this vehicle
with module assets.
] When you Finish an Expedition (dangerous or
greater) in your starship and score a hit, this
journey strengthened your ties to your ship
and any fellow travelers. You and your allies
may mark 1 tick on your bonds legacy track.
] When you Withstand Damage, you may roll
+heart. If you do, Endure Stress (-1) on a
weak hit or miss.

CONDITION METERS 49

## IMPACTSIMPACTS

As you suffer hardships and setbacks in your quests, you may need to  
mark impacts. These represent temporary, long-term, and permanent  
disadvantages. Moves will tell you when to mark an impact, or may give  
you a choice. Some impacts can be cleared by taking the time to recover.  
Others will forever become a part of your character.

There are several categories of impacts: misfortunes, vehicle troubles,  
burdens, and lasting effects.

Impacts have a mechanical effect by reducing your max momentum.  
Each marked impact reduces your max momentum (normally 10) by 1. For  
example, if you have three marked impacts, your max momentum is 7.

Impacts also reduce your momentum reset.

```
✴ If you have one marked impact, your momentum reset is +1 (instead
of +2).
✴ If you have more than one marked impact, your momentum reset is 0
(instead of +2).
```

### Misfortunes

```
✴ Wounded may be marked when you are at 0 health and fail to Endure
Harm. You are severely injured.
✴ Shaken may be marked when you are at 0 spirit and fail to Endure
Stress. You are despairing or distraught.
✴ Unprepared is marked when you Sacrifice Resources and are
reduced to 0 supply. You are not properly equipped for the dangers of
the Forge. Because you and your allies share the same supply value,
you mark unprepared together.
```

As with all impacts, misfortunes affect your max momentum and  
momentum reset. In addition, if you are wounded, shaken, or unprepared,  
you cannot increase the associated condition meter.

```
✴ If you are wounded, you cannot increase health.
✴ If you are shaken, you cannot increase spirit.
✴ If you are unprepared, you cannot increase supply.
```

If a move gives you an opportunity to raise your health, spirit, or supply  
while the associated misfortune is marked, you can’t take that option. You  
must clear the impact before improving the related condition meter.

Wounded, shaken, and unprepared can be cleared when you succeed  
on an appropriate recover move. For example, scoring a hit on the Heal  
move can clear the wounded impact. Once you clear the misfortune, you  
restore your max momentum and momentum reset, and you can once  
again increase the associated meter through moves.

50 CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

### Vehicle Troubles

```
✴ Battered may be marked when your vehicle is at 0 integrity and you
fail to Withstand Damage. The vehicle is barely holding together.
✴ Cursed may be marked when your command vehicle (STARSHIP
asset) is at 0 integrity and you fail to Withstand Damage. This is a
permanent impact. Your ship will never be quite right again.
```

Vehicle troubles are linked to a specific vehicle, either your command  
vehicle asset or a support vehicle asset. These impacts are only a factor  
when you are piloting or aboard that vehicle. Otherwise, they do not  
count as an impact and do not affect your maximum momentum and  
momentum reset.

Battered can be overcome when you successfully Repair that vehicle and  
clear the trouble. Until you do so, you cannot raise the vehicle’s integrity.  
Cursed is a permanent impact and will forever plague your STARSHIP.

To learn more about vehicle assets, see page 54. To learn more about  
vehicles in general in your Starforged campaign, see page 65.

**If playing with allies, a vehicle trouble affects anyone on the vehicle, If playing with allies, a vehicle trouble affects anyone on the vehicle,**

**regardless of who owns or manages the vehicle asset.regardless of who owns or manages the vehicle asset.**

IMPACTS 51

### Burdens

```
✴ Doomed is marked when you Face Death and return from death’s
door with a soul-bound quest.
✴ Tormented is marked when you Face Desolation, gain visions of a
distressing future, and undertake a quest to prevent that dire fate.
✴ Indebted is marked when you Overcome Destruction. To replace
what was lost and repay the debt, you will take on a duty-bound quest.
```

Burdens are a result of life-changing experiences that leave you bound  
to new vows. Clearing a burden can only be accomplished by resolving  
the quest.

While you are doomed, tormented, or indebted, you should envision the  
physical and emotional manifestations of these impacts. You have seen  
what lies beyond death, suffered visions of your greatest fears, or barely  
escaped the destruction of your prized starship. How do these events  
change you? What will you do to set things right?

### Lasting Effects

```
✴ Permanently harmed may be marked when you are at 0 health and
fail to Endure Harm. You have suffered a wound that you must reckon
with, such as the loss of an eye or hand. Or you bear physical scars
that are a constant reminder of a harrowing incident.
✴ Traumatized may be marked when you are at 0 spirit and fail to
Endure Stress. Your experiences have left you emotionally or
mentally scarred.
```

Lasting effects are permanent. They forever impact your character  
through the momentum adjustment and—more importantly—the  
narrative impact of being permanently harmed or traumatized. You  
should factor this impact into how you perform moves and how you  
interact with the world.

Envision the nature of the lasting effect. You may have physical,  
emotional, or mental factors you must take into account. Your outlook  
may change. Your goals and methods may change. How others behave  
toward you may change.

```
STARTS AT +10 / REDUCE BY 1 FOR EACH IMPACT
0 IMPACTS = +2 / 1 IMPACT = +1 / 2 OR MORE IMPACTS = 0
```

### Marking Impacts

```
To mark an impact on your character sheet, fill in the appropriate bubble.
Once an impact is marked, it cannot be marked again unless it is cleared.
If a move gives you a chance to choose an impact in place of a harsher
outcome, you cannot take that option if it is already marked.
```

#### TRACKING VEHICLE IMPACTS

```
Battered or cursed might apply to multiple vehicles, but are only relevant
when you are aboard a vehicle with an impact (including a support vehicle
managed by an ally).
If a vehicle is battered or cursed, mark that impact on the asset card. When
you go aboard, mark it on your character sheet under vehicle troubles as
a reminder.
```

```
ADJUSTING MOMENTUM
Once you mark an impact, adjust your max momentum and momentum
reset as detailed on page 37.
✴ If you have one impact marked, your momentum reset is +1.
✴ If you have more than one impact marked, your momentum reset is 0.
```

### OTHER IMPACTS

```
Certain assets offer abilities at the cost of counting as an impact for
your character. For example, the OATHBREAKER asset strengthens your
resolve as you pursue a quest of redemption, but counts as an impact until
you fulfill that vow.
You can mark these in the “Other Impacts” section of your character
sheet. They contribute as normal to your max momentum and momentum
reset penalties.
```

health to everyone whose health is greater
than 0. On a 5-6, make it +2.
```

## ASSETSASSETS

```
Assets are a key component of your character. They represent your
background, skills, traits, companions, and resources. They have abilities
that give you additional options and bonuses when making a move—or
sometimes act as their own self-contained moves.
When you create your character (page 100), you select your starting
assets. As you fill boxes on your legacy tracks, you Earn Experience. This
experience is spent to gain new assets or upgrade current assets.
Starforged assets are formatted as printable or preprinted cards. Put them
alongside your character sheet for easy reference.
```

54 CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

#### COMMAND VEHICLE

```
The command vehicle is
your interstellar STARSHIP.
It is a default asset for your
character, taken when you
begin your campaign. If you
are playing with others, this is a
shared asset; each of you may
use the STARSHIP’s abilities
while aboard the craft.
The command vehicle has
an integrity meter and starts
at 5 integrity. When your
STARSHIP takes a hit, make
the Withstand Damage move
to see what happens.
```

#### MODULES

```
Modules are linked to your
STARSHIP and offer additional
options and advantages when
aboard that vehicle.
These assets are earned and
managed by a single character.
They can be shared with allies,
but only if it’s practical for them
to make use of it (not everyone
may know how to use a
RESEARCH LAB).
When you Withstand Damage
and score a miss, you can
mark a module as broken to
offset further danger for your
STARSHIP. Flip the card over
to indicate its broken state. A
broken module cannot be used
until you successfully Repair it.
```

```
COMMAND VEHICLE
STARSHIP
```

```
[ Your armed, multipurpose starship is suited
for interstellar and atmospheric flight. It can
comfortably transport several people, has
space for cargo, and can carry and launch
support vehicles. When you Advance, you
may spend experience to equip this vehicle
with module assets.
] When you Finish an Expedition (dangerous or
greater) in your starship and score a hit, this
journey strengthened your ties to your ship
and any fellow travelers. You and your allies
may mark 1 tick on your bonds legacy track.
] When you Withstand Damage, you may roll
+heart. If you do, Endure Stress (-1) on a
weak hit or miss.

a hazardous specimen, reroll any dice.  
] When you Swear an Iron Vow to undertake  
a long-term research project (extreme or  
greater), reroll any dice. When you obtain  
crucial samples, equipment, or data,  
mark progress on the quest and take +2

time to the project in your lab, Face Danger  
and add +1. On a hit, mark progress. On  
a strong hit with a match, mark progress  
twice. When you Fulfill Your Vow and score  
a hit, also mark one box on your discoveries  
legacy track.

### Asset Types

There are six types of assets: command vehicle, modules, support  
vehicles, paths, companions, and deeds.

ASSETS 55

#### PATHS

```
Paths are your background,
interests, training, skills,
powers, and key equipment.
They provide mechanical
and narrative advantages,
but also reflect who you are
and how you interact with the
world. When you create your
character in the next chapter,
you’ll select at least two paths
to get started.
Some paths represent your
skill with a signature weapon
style or piece of equipment. If
you see a requirement at the
top of the asset card, such as “If
you wield a bladed weapon...,”
the asset is only usable when
taking action using that item.
```

#### SUPPORT VEHICLES

```
Support vehicles complement
your command vehicle for
planetside or short-range
operations. If you are playing
with others, one of you might
serve as the pilot or owner of
a support vehicle, but anyone
on board can use its abilities as
appropriate to the situation.
As with the command vehicle,
your support vehicles have
integrity meters. The maximum
integrity varies based on the
type of vehicle. When a support
vehicle faces a damaging
situation or environment, you
must Withstand Damage to
see how it fares.
```

```
SUPPORT VEHICLE
SHUTTLE
```

```
4 3 2 1 0 BATTERED
```

```
[ Your unarmed shuttle provides short-range
transport for several people and equipment
through space or atmosphere. When you
travel to a location (not your command
vehicle), you and your allies may take +1
momentum when you arrive
] When you Face Danger or React Under Fire
to navigate through hazardous skies, avoid
obstacles, or evade an attack, add +1 and
take +1 momentum on a hit.
] Your shuttle is sealed against high pressure
environments, can travel underwater, and
is more resistant to damage; when you
Withstand Damage, add +1.
```

```
NAME
```

```
PATH
SCAVENGER
```

```
[ When you Gather Information or Resupply
by scavenging a wreck, ruin, or abandoned
site, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.
On a strong hit with a match, you also find
something of unique value, significance,
or function; envision the nature of this
discovery, take +2 momentum, and mark 2
ticks on your discoveries legacy track.
] When you Secure an Advantage to cobble
together an ad hoc tool, device, or weapon,
envision what you intend to create. On a hit,
you may add +1 when making a move aided
by the item. If you roll a 1 on your action
die while using the item, it is permanently
broken, lost, or depleted.
] When you Check Your Gear, roll +wits or
+supply (whichever is highest) and take +1
momentum on a hit.
```

56 CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

#### COMPANIONS

```
Companions are NPC helpers.
When you gain a companion,
give them a name and envision
their look and personality.
Companions utilize a health
meter that can be reduced
if an outcome puts them
in harm’s way. When your
companion faces harm, make
the Companion Takes a Hit
move. When their health is at
0, they are in danger of being
killed or destroyed.
```

#### DEEDS

```
Deeds represent the notable
achievement and situations
of your story, and how those
events change your character.
Deeds have a requirement
listed at the top of the card,
phrased as “Once you [blank].”
You may not spend experience
to acquire a deed until you
fulfill the requirement, and you
cannot choose a deed when
creating your character.
```

```
COMPANION
GLOWCAT
```

```
3 2 1 0 OUT OF ACTION
```

```
[ Your glowcat companion perceives the
inner emotions and intentions of people
and creatures in its vicinity, and embodies
those impressions through the colors and
intensity of its luminescent fur. When you
Secure an Advantage by studying the
glowcat’s reactions in a charged interaction,
add +its health.
] When you Compel, the glowcat’s reactions
will help guide your approach; you may
reroll your action die if its value is less than
the glowcat’s health.
] When you Endure Stress in the company of
the glowcat, add +1. On a strong hit with a
match, take +momentum equal to their health.
```

```
NAME

```
[ You have chosen or established a community
as your home. When you Swear an Iron Vow
(formidable or greater) in service to your
home, reroll any dice. On a hit, mark 1 tick
on your bonds legacy track. When you Fulfill
Your Vow and score a hit, also mark 2 ticks
on your bonds legacy track.
] When you Sojourn in your home, choose one.
✴ Don’t linger: Take an automatic weak hit
✴ Stay a bit: Add +1 and take +1 momentum
on a hit
] When you Set a Course for home, you may
reroll your action die if its value is less than
your spirit.
```

ASSETS 57

### Assets and the Fiction

Assets offer both mechanical and narrative advantages. For example,  
if you have the HEALER path, you benefit from that asset’s abilities as  
you make moves to treat others, diagnose illnesses, and study biological  
remains. It also provides justification to take actions other characters  
would not be capable of, such as advanced treatment techniques.

But even when you aren’t making moves, the HEALER path influences  
your character’s interests, manner, and opportunities. In a perilous galaxy  
where technology has limitations and resources are scarce, how does this  
valued expertise affect your relationships and the nature of your quests?  
How is it reflected in your personality and ambitions?

Some assets will be more influential than others in your character concept,  
but all of them contribute to how you envision your approaches and the  
situations you encounter.

58 CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

### Acquiring and Upgrading Assets

When you create your character in the next chapter, you will take your  
STARSHIP and choose three other assets. Then, as you successfully  
overcome challenges and mark progress on your legacy tracks (page  
44 ), you Earn Experience. This experience is spent to purchase or  
upgrade assets through the Advance move.

BUYING AN ASSET

Buying a new asset costs 3 experience. If you are playing with others, you  
should avoid picking the same asset as another player—this will help give  
each character their own capabilities and flavor.

UPGRADING AN ASSET

All assets include three abilities.  
The first will be filled in when  
you purchase the asset.  
Upgrading an asset to claim the  
second or third ability costs 2  
experience each.

When you spend experience  
to upgrade an asset, fill in the  
dot on your asset card to show  
you’ve acquired the ability. The  
second and third abilities may  
be selected in any order.

BUILDING A STORY  
THROUGH ASSETS

You can Advance to spend  
experience when it is earned, or  
save it for future use. Either way,  
you should look to the fiction  
to give context and justification for your new abilities and resources. Let  
your selection of assets flow naturally from your character’s goals and the  
situations you encounter, or guide your story toward an asset you would  
like to purchase or upgrade.

Assets can even serve as the focus of a new vow, giving you a tangible  
objective or reward for undertaking a quest. Perhaps you gain a new  
SNUB FIGHTER by completing a quest in the service of a shipbuilder, or  
earn membership as a sanctioned TRADER in the merchant’s guild.

Envisioning how your new abilities connect to your sworn quests and  
experiences gives them additional significance and context. They will be a  
reminder of the paths taken and not taken, the challenges overcome, and  
the bonds formed.

```
PATH
KINETIC
```

```
[ You wield kinetic powers. By focusing, you
may remotely push, pull, lift, or constrict
objects and beings that are about your size
or smaller. When you are in a risky situation
and draw on your powers to make a move,
add +2 and Lose Momentum (-2).
] As above, but you may instead draw on
your powers in a desperate effort to change
the outcome of an action. If you do, add +2
(after you roll) and Lose Momentum (-3).
] When your momentum is at its max, you
may attempt great kinetic feats, such as
manipulating large objects and creating
destructive bursts of concussive force. To
do so, reset momentum. Then, as you make
a single move fueled by your powers, take
an automatic strong hit. If you are in a fight,
mark progress.
```

```
[
```

ASSETS 59

## ORACLESORACLES

In Starforged, an oracle is anything that generates random results to help  
determine the outcome of a move, the details of locations or characters,  
or a narrative event.

In solo or co-op games, oracles help answer questions, flesh out your  
setting, and introduce drama and surprises. In guided play, the guide can  
use oracles for their own inspiration and answers.

Starforged includes various oracle tables to generate random results.  
Some moves include their own tables. There are also a large variety of  
random tables starting in Chapter 5 (page 288) that can help provide  
inspiration for story events, reveal locations, generate characters and  
creatures, and guide the actions of others in your world.

### Rolling Oracle Dice

Whenever you are prompted to generate a result between 1 and 100, roll  
two ten-sided dice. This is an oracle roll.

Using physical dice, there are two common methods for generating a  
1–100 result. You can roll a set of D10s that includes tens digits on the  
faces of one of those dice.

Or you can use two D10s of different colors, and decide before rolling  
which represents the tens digit and which is the units.

Either way, you might want to use a unique set of dice for oracle rolls,  
shared by everyone at the table. These dice will divine your fate and reveal  
the mysteries of the galaxy, so it’s worth giving them special treatment.

```
ENDURE STRESS
When you face mental strain, shock, or despair, suffer -1 spirit for
minor stress, -2 for serious stress, or -3 for major stress. If your spirit
is 0, Lose Momentum equal to any remaining stress
Then, if your spirit is 0 or you choose to resist the stress, roll +spirit
or +heart, whichever is higher.
On a strong hit, choose one.
✴ Shake it off: If you are not shaken, take +1 spirit
✴ Embrace the darkness: Take +1 momentum
On a weak hit, if you are not shaken, you may Lose Momentum (-1) in
exchange for +1 spirit. Otherwise, press on.
On a miss, it’s worse than you thought. Suffer an additional -1 spirit
or Lose Momentum (-2). If your spirit is 0, you must also mark shaken
or traumatized, or roll on the table below.
```

```
1–10 You are overwhelmed. Face Desolation.
11–25 You give up. Forsake Your Vow.
26–50 You give in to fear or compulsion, and act against your
better instincts.
51–100You persevere.
```

### Oracle Tables In Moves

Some moves may prompt you to roll on an oracle table, generating a  
result between 1 and 100, to help resolve the outcome of that move. For  
example, the Endure Stress table reveals your fate when you fail to resist  
a mental hardship. Will you carry on or will this crisis get the best of you?

If a move tells you to “roll or choose” on an oracle table, you decide  
whether you pick the most interesting or appropriate result, or roll to see  
what happens. Otherwise, you have no choice; you must cast your fate to  
the stars and roll the oracle dice.

**Unlike your action rolls—unless a specific oracle table indicates Unlike your action rolls—unless a specific oracle table indicates**

ORACLES 61

```
ASK THE ORACLE
When you seek to resolve questions, discover details, reveal
locations, determine how other characters respond, or trigger
encounters or events, you may...
✴ Draw a conclusion: Decide the answer based on the most
interesting and obvious result.
✴ Spark an idea: Use an oracle table or other random prompt.
✴ Ask a yes/no question: Decide the odds of a yes, and roll on the
table below to check the answer.
✴ Pick two: Envision two options. Rate one as ‘likely’, and roll on
the table below to see if it is true. If not, it is the other.
```

```
Odds The answer is ‘yes’ if you roll...
Small Chance 10 or less
Unlikely 25 or less
50/50 50 or less
Likely 75 or less
Almost Certain 90 or less
```

```
On a match, envision an extreme result or twist.
```

### Asking the Oracle

If you are playing solo or co-op, you can make the Ask the Oracle move  
(shown below) to help guide your campaign and trigger ideas when you  
need to know what happens next. Its most basic function is to answer a  
“yes” or “no” question. Combined with your own instincts and creativity,  
this move—and other random prompts—can push your story in surprising  
and exciting directions.

Unlike other tables, a match is meaningful when rolling on the Ask  
the Oracle yes/no table. If you roll a match, envision the answer as an  
especially decisive yes or no, or give it a dramatic or interesting twist.

If you are playing with a guide, they are the oracle. When you have a  
question or see a prompt to Ask the Oracle, that’s your cue to look to  
your guide for the answer. The guide can decide the answer, or use  
random tools and creative prompts for inspiration. They can even turn  
the question back to you, or ask you to roll on an oracle table. But keep in  
mind that—even when playing with a guide—Starforged is about shared  
storytelling. Offer suggestions. Talk it out. The guide is the final arbiter  
of what happens next, but everyone at the table should participate in  
building the world and creating the narrative of your campaign.

62 CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

### A Universe of Oracles

This rulebook includes an array of oracle tables in Chapter 5 (page 288).  
Use these oracles to answer questions about your setting, drive the  
narrative, and inspire dramatic events and revelations. Some oracles are  
for specific, mundane questions to streamline play (“What is the smuggler’s  
name?”). Others provide more abstract results that you interpret based on  
the current situation (“What do I encounter here?”).

Perhaps most importantly, that section includes a variety of oracles to  
help you visualize locations as you explore the Forge, ranging from the  
nature of a star to the details of a planetside settlement. The Starforged  
universe is meant to be discovered as you play, revealing new dangers  
and wonders; these oracles are your guide on that journey.

OTHER RANDOM GENERATORS

You can also use whatever oracles you prefer, including those drawn  
from another game, online generators, or visual tools such as tarot cards.  
Assembling your personalized toolkit of oracles will help customize the  
tone and setting of the game to your preferences.

CREATING YOUR OWN ORACLES

Create your own oracle tables to better fit your preferences or highlight  
unique aspects of your campaign. For example, you can create a table for  
encounters within an unusual planetary environment, or a table of random  
names suited to a particular faction or culture.

### Trust Your Instincts

Random generators don’t replace your own imagination and intuition. If  
it’s interesting, dramatic, and pushes the story forward, make it happen.  
Too much reliance on random generators to answer questions about  
“what happens next” can kill the momentum of your game or make it feel  
disconnected and incoherent.

Keep it moving. Ask a question. If an answer leaps to mind, go with it. If  
you’re not sure, Ask the Oracle. Then, play.

ORACLES 63

## EQUIPMENTEQUIPMENT

As noted earlier, your supply meter (page 48) is an abstract  
representation of your overall readiness. You are otherwise armed,  
armored, and equipped as appropriate to your vision of your character.

Some assets can make specific equipment more relevant to your  
character. If you are a GEARHEAD, you probably envision yourself always  
having a toolkit at the ready. Combat-centric assets such as GUNNER  
represent your expertise in a particular weapon or fighting style. These  
tools reinforce your character’s approach and skills.

Other equipment provides narrative benefit. It enables you to make moves  
where that gear is important, or perhaps allows you to avoid the risky  
nature of a move altogether.

```
You must make your way down a steep rock face on a barren desert
planet. Without assistance, you’d make the Face Danger move to
see what happens. If you had rope, the climb is not particularly
risky or uncertain. In that case, you can skip the move and just
envision the result.
```

Make note of equipment at whatever level of detail you like, but don’t fuss  
over it. During the character creation exercise you’ll receive your spacer  
kit (page 112), which includes fundamental gear for exploring a perilous  
galaxy. If you ever need to know if you have a specific helpful item, make  
the Check Your Gear move.

DEPICTING TECHNOLOGY IN THE FORGE

By default, life in the Forge is a retro-future. It is the future as viewed  
through a lens of what we imagined two or three decades ago, instead of  
what we can envision today. It is also a resource-scarce future, with much  
of your people’s knowledge and resources lost following the cataclysm  
that drove you to the Forge.

That said, the technology you bring to bear—or resist—is flexible to how  
you envision the nature of the setting. Is a typical gun a blaster that fires  
plasma bursts, or an old-fashioned slug thrower? Are spacecraft sleek  
and powerful, or are they ungainly, fragile machines held together with  
fervent prayer? Your setting can suffer from class disparity, with advanced  
tech under the control of the wealthy and powerful, while everyone else is  
forced to make do with more primitive resources. Meanwhile, scavengers  
searching the ancient places of the Forge might unearth technologies of  
strange and terrible power.

The truths you define for the Forge in the next chapter help frame the  
nature of equipment and tech in your campaign.

64 CHAPTER 1: THE BASICS

## VEHICLESVEHICLES

There are three types of vehicles you’ll rely on as your travel through the  
perilous depths of the Forge.

### Command Vehicle

Your command vehicle (page 55) is your STARSHIP asset, earned at  
character creation. It is an interstellar craft capable of faster-than-light  
travel. If you are playing with others, you and your allies share this asset.  
If you are playing in solo mode, you can fly the ship as a lone spacer  
thanks to automation and centralized controls. The command vehicle has  
an integrity meter, and can suffer from battered or cursed impacts.

See pages 66 – 67 for a cutaway illustration of a typical STARSHIP.

### Support Vehicles

Support vehicles (page 56) are assets that represent special secondary  
vehicles. They can be carried and launched by your STARSHIP. They have  
an integrity meter, and can suffer from the battered impact.

### Incidental Vehicles

An incidental vehicle is one you temporarily acquire through the course  
of your story. For example, if you need to journey across the surface of an  
ocean world, you might borrow a sea-skimmer from a local settlement.

Incidental vehicles have an integrity meter, but cannot be marked as  
battered. When you board an incidental vehicle, envision its nature and  
assign a max integrity as follows.

If you or an ally aren’t controlling a vehicle—you’re just along for the ride—  
it’s not an incidental vehicle and does not have an integrity meter.

## NAVIGATING THE NAVIGATING THE FORGEFORGE

The depiction of interstellar travel in Starforged is tied to the gameplay  
of the exploration moves (page 168). These moves help frame your  
journeys and encourage exploration and discovery.

You can ignore the setting details described below, and envision interstellar  
flight as you like. However, it works best if you use a similar approach, with  
faster-than-light (FTL) travel undertaken in a series of individual segments.  
Think of your starship as a stone skipping across a vast galactic pond.

### Eidolon Travel

Interstellar starships that travel the Forge—including your character’s  
ship—are equipped with eidolon drives (commonly referred to as  
e-drives). These devices harness the turbulent forces of the Forge to  
propel vessels along optimal paths at FTL speeds.

DRIFTS AND PASSAGES

Drifts are the network of eidolon paths through the Forge. Spacers guide  
their starships along the gravitational currents, stellar winds, and fiery  
energies of the drifts like surfers on the crest of a wave.

A plotted course along drifts is called a passage. Important locations in  
settled areas are usually connected by passages. But this navigational data  
is a valuable resource, often greedily held by those in power. Others must  
trailblaze their own paths. Beyond settled regions, potential passages are  
usually uncharted and unexplored.

Even when following a passage, it’s not just a matter of flying from point A  
to point B. Piloting the drifts requires skilled navigation. Spacers must be  
on watch for navigational hazards and lurking foes.

Worse yet, some say eidolon travel weakens the fragile bonds of reality.  
Explorers tell stories of horrifying visions or visitations among the drifts.  
Spacers are superstitious folk, and often employ wards and rituals to keep  
eidolon “ghosts” at bay.

ANCHORAGES

An e-drive can stay powered for a few hours at most, and requires several  
hours to reenergize. Thus, long voyages are made in a series of FTL  
transits. Each segment of the journey ends at a waypoint—what is called  
an anchorage. Since powerful gravity wells are an ideal navigational  
target, anchorages are often near a large object such as a star or planet.

Once emerging from the drifts at an anchorage, the ship slows while the  
e-drive is powered back up. You can sit back and enjoy the scenery during  
this layover, or go take a look at nearby locations.

NAVIGATING THE FORGENAVIGATING THE FORGE 6969

### Seeing What’s Out There

When you pilot your starship on an interstellar journey through uncharted  
space, make the Undertake an Expedition move to see how you fare.  
Anchorages are a waypoint that helps define progress on that journey.  
When you emerge from eidolon travel at an anchorage, envision the  
moment as your starship decelerates to sublight speeds: The hull rattles,  
warning tones beep, and sensor displays spring to life.

NEAR OBJECTS

When traveling the Forge, you can simply envision the beautiful but  
mundane sites you encounter. A sky filled with the cold light of distant  
suns. Clouds of stellar dust. Barren planetoids drifting in their lonely orbits.

If you want to give a segment of your travel additional focus, Ask the  
Oracle and use the random prompts in Chapter 5, starting with the Space  
Sightings table (page 300). You might find a fiery star looming in your  
cockpit windows, a vibrant planet, a starship carrying a fellow traveler, or  
even a spaceborne creature. The Space Sightings table may prompt you  
to roll twice or three times for multiple objects.

These objects are near your starship. If you want to travel to a near object  
or get in a better position to observe it, your starship’s main engines will  
carry you there in a matter of minutes. If you find something worthy of  
further exploration, you can Explore a Waypoint. Unusual locations, such  
as a precursor vault or derelict, might even warrant their own expedition.

FAR OBJECTS

If you want to look deeper into the depths of an anchorage, roll on the  
Space Sightings table again to see if there is anything interesting far from  
your starship. Envision yourself studying scanner data and visual displays,  
peering through the Forge’s stellar gases. This doesn’t require a move  
unless you’re under pressure—it’s just a routine part of being a spacer.

If you see something interesting at far range and want to check it out, it’ll  
take a while. Sublight travel is ponderous. You’re also diverting power from  
energizing the e-drive, so all told the detour will cost about a day. For an  
explorer, this might be time well spent. For a spacer on an urgent mission,  
it’s a needless distraction. Either way, unless you’re dealing with something  
risky, this doesn’t trigger a move. Point your ship in the right direction,  
envision the journey, and play to see what happens when you arrive.

OUT OF RANGE OBJECTS

Anything beyond far range is out of range. Objects at this distance are  
of no concern—they are too far away to cause you trouble, and it would  
take too long to travel there using your main engines. Objects smaller  
and dimmer than a star are probably shrouded in the stellar muck and  
electromagnetic interference of the Forge anyway. Perhaps that’s for the  
best; some things are best left undiscovered.

## THE THE FLOW OF PLAYFLOW OF PLAY

Like most roleplaying games, you play Starforged primarily from the  
perspective of your character. What are you doing? What are you trying to  
achieve? What opposition and challenges do you face? Your quests, and  
the characters and situations you encounter, will guide the fiction and the  
choices you make.

When you have questions about what you find, how other characters in  
your setting respond, or what happens next, you can go with what feels  
right if you’re playing solo or co-op. If you are playing in guided mode, ask  
the guide. When you seek inspiration or want to put it in the hands of fate,  
make the Ask the Oracle move. Use the yes/no questions and random  
oracle tables to generate interesting twists, complications, locations, and  
characters you might not have thought of on your own. Above all, if it’s  
interesting, dramatic and fits the fiction, make it happen.

When you do something or encounter a situation covered by a move, refer  
to the move. If it tells you to roll dice, do it.

```
A strong hit means you are in control. You are driving the
narrative and taking proactive actions. What do you do next?
```

```
A weak hit means the situation is slipping out of your control.
Instead of acting, you react. How do you respond?
```

```
A miss means you have lost control of the situation. You
might need to overcome new dangers or face increasing
risk. What happens next?
```

If you’re playing with a guide, they’ll help determine how the other  
characters respond and how the situation evolves. They may ask you  
questions. Otherwise, you rely on your intuition and occasional oracle  
rolls to drive the narrative.

This basic gameplay structure is illustrated on the next page.

### What’s Next

That’s the basics of Starforged. In the next chapter (page 74), you’ll  
define the nature of your setting, create your character, and launch your  
campaign. If you are playing with others, do those exercises together to  
forge your universe.

Once you begin play, you can refer back to this chapter if you have  
questions. If you want to learn about a specific game term in a move or  
asset, check the glossary on page 388.

## PREPARE FOR LIFTOFFPREPARE FOR LIFTOFF

In this chapter, you’ll launch your Starforged campaign by deciding the  
truths of your setting, creating a character, generating a starting location,  
and swearing an iron vow to undertake a perilous quest. These guided  
exercises will walk you through each step of the process.

### Prep Is Play

Starforged is designed for jump-in gameplay. Whether you are playing  
solo, teaming up with other players for a co-op campaign, or facilitating a  
game as the guide, you don’t need to prepare for a session. Instead, you  
can pick up where you left off and play to see what happens.

These exercises are the exception. Using them, you create a foundation  
of setting, character, and narrative opportunities. Then, you build on  
that foundation through play. This initial investment of time and creative  
energy is narrative momentum for your imagined world.

Also, here’s a secret: You’re already playing the game. What you’ll  
do through the course of these exercises—make decisions based on  
established fiction, consult oracles, interpret creative prompts, envision  
people, places, and situations—is all part of playing Starforged.

In short, these exercises should be fun. They should spark your creativity.  
They should make you excited about diving into the world you’ve created.  
If anything feels like work, skip it or take a shortcut and move on.

### Returning to an Existing campaign

If you completed these exercises previously and are returning to an  
established setting with a new character, you can shortcut or ignore many  
of the exercises in this chapter. Instead, get started by jumping to the  
summary on page 102 for a recap of character creation.

Then, if you have an inciting incident and initial quest in mind, you’re all  
set! Otherwise, go to page 128 for advice on beginning your adventure.

INTRODUCING A NEW PLAYER

If you are introducing a new player to an existing campaign, you can  
use the truths exercise (page 81) to help summarize the nature of  
your setting. While you are doing this, make note of any truths that have  
evolved through play.

If there are open questions or unexplored aspects of your campaign, use  
the exercise to give the new player a role in fleshing out those truths.  
Collaborate with them to identify aspects of the setting they might want  
to explore.

PREPARE FOR LIFTOFF 77

### Prioritizing Player Safety

Safety tools enable players to check in with one another before, during,  
and after a roleplaying session to ensure everyone feels safe and  
supported, especially when things in-game get tense, dark, or frightening.  
These tools focus on consent, collaboration, and prioritizing people at  
the table over the narrative. While many safety tools exist and are freely  
available, Starforged includes safety tools as part of the session moves  
(page 140).

The point of these session moves and other safety tools is not to suppress  
or sanitize your ideas, but rather to facilitate consent and comfort to the  
subject matter, events, and actions of the game at all times. Because you  
define your setting assumptions using the exercises in this chapter, you  
are aware of some of the themes and events likely to emerge in play;  
but you can’t predict exactly what might happen during the course of  
your game.

TRAUMA IN THE FORGE

The Forge is a place full of danger and mystery, and your character  
may encounter situations that put them in harm’s way or leave them  
with lingering trauma. It is very important to remember that while your  
character may get hurt, stressed, or traumatized within the fiction of the  
game, it should still be at a level you find it enjoyable or comfortable as a  
player. There are many ways to lean into the dangers of the Forge without  
trespassing on personal boundaries or compromising your own safety  
and comfort.

SAFETY TOOLS AND SOLO PLAY

Boundaries and consent are important when playing with others, since we  
cannot predict what someone else will do or say. But the importance of  
safety tools while playing solo may not be entirely obvious.

In some ways, safety tools become even more vital in solo play; playing  
alone means you’re responsible for your own check-ins. You have the  
freedom to explore content you may not be comfortable exploring in  
group settings, but also run the risk of making the game uncomfortable or  
un-fun without becoming aware of it until it is too late. The session moves  
encourage you to pause, reflect, and decide if, when, and how you want  
to move forward.

78 CHAPTER 2: LAUNCHING YOUR CAMPAIGN

#### SETTING CONTENT FLAGS

Take a moment to review the session moves with everyone at the table.  
You’ll find a printable moves reference as part of the Starforged Playkit,  
available for download at ironswornrpg.com.

As you work through the campaign launch exercises and anytime during  
play, use the Set a Flag move to identify content boundaries. This can  
include content that will be omitted, modified, or addressed on a case-by-  
case basis if it is encountered in your game.

Work together with other players to ensure a collaborative environment  
where everyone can Set a Flag. But keep in mind that using this move  
should not force a discussion of a content boundary. Players do not need  
to provide details or justification. If that is their wish, note the flagged  
content and move on.

USING OTHER SAFETY TOOLS

You might find that the Starforged session moves don’t fit the needs of  
your table. Each person is unique in what safety tools work for them, and  
many other safety tools address this variety of needs. You can explore  
resources like the TTRPG Safety Toolkit to find safety tools that work best  
for you and your game. The TTRPG Safety Toolkit, curated by Kienna  
Shaw and Lauren Bryant-Monk, is a compilation of safety tools designed  
by members of the tabletop roleplaying game community. You can find it  
here: bit.ly/ttrpgsafetytoolkit.

### SET A FLAG

```
When you identify situations or topics you don’t want to
include, don’t want to envision in detail, or otherwise may need
mindfulness when approaching, that content is now flagged.
When you encounter content flagged as something to approach
mindfully, pause to consider or discuss its role in your story. When
you come across flagged content that you would rather adjust or
omit, Change Your Fate.

## CHOOSE YOUR CHOOSE YOUR TRUTHSTRUTHS

In this exercise, you’ll set the tone and background for your campaign by  
deciding the nature of your version of the Forge. These are your truths.  
When you’re done, you’ll have key aspects of your setting sketched out,  
and a backdrop of challenges to help fuel your adventures.

```
Allow about 45–60 minutes for this exercise.
```

### Default Assumptions

Since science fiction is a genre full of possibilities, it’s important to first  
establish some key pillars for how you’ll envision your adventures in  
Starforged. The following points are all generally true, and represent  
your default starting place. If you are working through this exercise with a  
group, read or summarize these points aloud.

```
This is a perilous future. Two centuries ago, your people fled a
cataclysm and settled a distant galaxy they call the Forge. This is a
chaotic place full of dangers and mysteries.
This is a lonely future. With some possible exceptions (that you’ll
identify as part of your own truths), humans are the only known
intelligent life in this galaxy. Others once lived here, but only mysterious
and perilous vaults remain to mark their legacy.
This is a diverse future. There is a vibrant mix of people and cultures
among the humans of the Forge.
This is a far-flung future. Settlements lie scattered and often isolated
from one another. Your starship can travel at faster-than-light speeds,
but it’s ponderously slow at a cosmic scale.
This is an unexplored future. Discoveries await. Even in settled
regions, much of the Forge is unknown and uncharted.
This is a wondrous future. The Forge is a galaxy of ancient mysteries,
spacefaring creatures, startling phenomenon, and other marvels.
This is a retro-future. Envision the technology you wield as only slightly
advanced over today’s real-world technologies—or even a step back in
many ways. Resources are scarce, and the people of the Forge must
cobble together what they can.
This is an unjust future. Those in power hoard resources, control
technologies, and impose their will on others through force or cunning.
Others must stand against these forces of imperialism and oppression.
This is a hopeful future. Despite these challenges, hope remains.
Fulfilling your sworn vows is a realization of that hope.
```

CHOOSE YOUR TRUTHS 81

### The Truth Categories

The following section includes 14 categories to help define key aspects  
of the setting.

The categories are:

Cataclysm Page 84 Communication and Data Page 92

Exodus Page 86 Medicine Page 93

Communities Page 87 Artificial Intelligence Page 94

Iron Page 88 War Page 95

Laws Page 89 Lifeforms Page 96

Magic Page 91 Horrors Page 98

### What You Need

Visit ironswornrpg.com for a printable version of this activity, or just use  
your journal or notepaper. Also grab two ten-sided dice, and have the  
character asset cards handy.

### How to Select Your Truths

Select your truth for each category in one of three ways. Mix and match  
these techniques as you like.

```
Choose a truth
from the three
options.
```

```
Roll for a truth
using your
oracle dice.
```

```
Customize a
truth, or craft
your own.
```

A few truths also include subchoices in oracle tables. As with the main  
categories, you can choose, roll, or customize from among them.

#### OR OR

82 CHAPTER 2: LAUNCHING YOUR CAMPAIGN

### Tips for Managing This Exercise

#### KEEP IT MOVING

When looking at the options in a category, read the bolded text as a quick  
summary of your choices. The details and quest starters are there for  
further inspiration after you make a pick.

If a particular category isn’t relevant to your evolving setting, or doesn’t  
interest you right now, ignore it and move on. You can come back to this  
exercise later to make a decision for a truth when you encounter that  
aspect in play.

CONDUCTING THE EXERCISE AS A GROUP ACTIVITY

If you’re playing Starforged with others, give everyone at the table an  
opportunity to influence each choice.

If you want to structure the exercise, choose a player to serve as the  
mediator for each category. As mediator, you read the truths, guide the  
discussion, and make a final decision. Then the player on your left acts as  
the mediator for the next category. And so on.

LEAVING UNANSWERED QUESTIONS

Don’t get mired in details. Create the broad outlines for your campaign,  
while leaving room for inspiration and surprises. If an unanswered  
question is interesting to you, consider how you might explore that aspect  
of the setting in play.

RESOLVING CONTRADICTIONS

If you encounter contradictions from one category to another, feel free  
to bend the truths to better fit your emerging setting. But seeming  
contradictions can be the foundation of great stories. You may even  
discover through play that a choice you make here—which reflects  
common knowledge—isn’t the actual truth after all.

STARTING TO ENVISION YOUR CHARACTER

Each category offers prompts to consider your character’s background  
and perspective, marked with this icon: ^. Take a moment to consider  
any aspects interesting to you, and gloss over those you prefer to ignore  
or discover in play.

Recommended assets for your character are shown with the asset title in  
ALL CAPS. If a suggested asset interests you, set that asset card aside or  
make a note. You’ll pick your assets when you create your character in the  
next exercise.

CHOOSE YOUR TRUTHS 83

### Cataclysm

```
1–33 The Sun Plague extinguished the stars in our home galaxy.
The anomaly traveled at incredible speeds, many times faster
than light itself, and snuffed out the stars around us before we
realized it was coming. Few of us survived as we made our way
to this new galaxy. Here in the Forge, the stars are still aflame. We
cling to their warmth like weary travelers huddled around a fire.
We suspect the Sun Plague was caused by:
```

```
1–25 Temporal distortions from a supermassive black hole
26–50 Sudden dark matter decay
51–75 Superweapon run amok
76–100 Scientific experiment gone awry
```

```
Quest Starter: The galaxy your people left behind is a cold,
lightless grave. But a solitary star still glows, a beacon in a vast
darkness. How did this star survive the plague? Why do you
vow to find the means to travel across the immeasurable gulf
to this distant light?
```

```
34–67 Interdimensional entities invaded our reality.
Without warning, these implacable and enigmatic beings
ravaged our homeworlds. We could not stand against them. With
the last of our defenses destroyed, our hope gone, we cast our
fate to the Forge. Here, we can hide. Survive.
These entities took the form of:
```

```
1–15 Corrupting biological scourges
16–30 Swarming, animalistic creatures
31–44 Monstrous humanoids
45–58 Spirits of alluring, divine form
59–72 Beings of chaotic energy
73–86 Titanic creatures of horrific power
87–100 World-eating abominations of unimaginable scale
```

```
Quest Starter: Here in the Forge, a rogue faction holds an
artifact of these interdimensional entities. What is the nature
of this relic? What power or dark fate does the faction intend
to unleash?
```

See the next page for the 68–100 result.

84 CHAPTER 2: LAUNCHING YOUR CAMPAIGN

```
68–100 We escaped the ravages of a catastrophic war.
Over millennia, we consumed resources and shattered lives as
we fueled the engines of industry, expansion, and war. In the
end, a powerful foe took advantage of our rivalries in a violent
bid for power. Fleeing the devastation, we assembled our fleets
and traveled to the Forge. A new home. A fresh start.
In this final war, we were set upon by:
```

```
1–20 Artificial intelligence
21–40 Religious zealots
41–60 Genetically engineered soldiers
61–80 Self-replicating nanomachines
81–100 A tyrannical faction or leader
```

```
Quest Starter: A delegation of your dreaded foe arrives in the
Forge. They claim to represent a rebel force seeking sanctuary.
In return, they offer vital information. What news do they carry?
```

^Do you possess a keepsake or artifact of pre-cataclysm society? What  
is it? Why is it important to you? If you are all that remains of a people or  
culture, you might be a VESTIGE.

CHOOSE YCHOOSE YOUR TRUTHSOUR TRUTHS 85

### Exodus

```
1–33 When the Exodus fleet set off on a ponderous journey to
a new home outside our galaxy, they marked the Forge as
their destination. Countless generations lived out their lives
aboard those titanic ships during the millennia-long passage.
The refugees built a rich legacy of culture and tradition during
the Exodus. Some even remained in the ships after their arrival
in the Forge, unwilling or unable to leave their familiar confines.
Those vessels, the Ironhomes, still sail the depths of this galaxy.
Quest Starter: Your dreams are plagued by visions of a lost and
crippled Exodus ship. What do you see? Why does it call to you?
```

```
34–67 A ragtag fleet of ships—propelled at tremendous speeds by
experimental FTL drives—carried our ancestors to the Forge.
But the technology that powered the ships is said to be the
source of the Sundering, a fracturing of reality that plagues
us here today.
The experimental drives used by the Exodus fleet are forbidden,
but the damage is done. The Sundering spreads across our
reality like cracks on the surface of an icy pond. Those fissures
unleash even more perilous realities upon our own. Did we flee
one cataclysm, only to inadvertently create another?
```

```
Quest Starter: A malfunctioning drive sent one of the refugee
ships through space and time. Centuries later, they have finally
arrived. For them, only weeks have passed. Why are these
people mistrusted? Do you aid or oppose them?
```

```
68–100 Mysterious alien gates provided instantaneous one-way
passage to the Forge.
In the midst of the cataclysm, our ancestors found a strange
metal pillar on our homeworld’s moon. A map on the surface
of this alien relic detailed the deep-space locations of the Iron
Gates—massive devices that powered artificial wormholes. With
no other options, the Exodus ships fled through the gates and
emerged here in the Forge.
```

```
Quest Starter: An explorer brings news. They’ve located an active
gate in the depths of the Forge. Why do you swear to travel there?
Which power or foe seeks to take control of the gate?
```

^Does your family or cultural history offer any stories of the Exodus? How  
does this legacy impact you today? If you are dedicated to expanding the  
reach of your people within the Forge, you might be an EXPLORER. If you  
are exiled or reviled, you might be an OUTCAST.

86 CHAPTER 2: LAUNCHING YOUR CAMPAIGN

### Communities

```
1–33 Few survived the journey to the Forge, and we are scattered
to the winds in this perilous place.
Our settlements are often small, starved for resources, and on
the brink of ruin. Hundreds of far-flung settlements are lost and
isolated within the untamed chaos of this galaxy, and we do not
know their fate.
Quest Starter: A settlement on an icebound planet is found
abandoned. There is no sign of an attack. No bodies. Their ships
and vehicles sit idle. The people are simply gone. Vanished.
What is your connection to this place?
```

```
34–67 Dangers abound, but there is safety in numbers. Many ships
and settlements are united under the banner of one of the
Founder Clans.
We have a tentative foothold in this galaxy. Each of the five
Founder Clans honor the name and legacy of a leader who
guided their people in the chaotic time after the Exodus. Vast
reaches of the settled domains are claimed by the clans, and
territorial skirmishes are common.
```

```
Quest Starter: A forsaken people, sworn to no clan, live on an
orbital station. A recent illness left many sick or dead. Supplies
are urgently needed. Why were these people exiled, and why
do you swear to give them aid? Which clan stands against you?
```

```
68–100 We have made our mark in this galaxy, but the energy storms
we call balefires threaten to undo that progress, leaving our
communities isolated and vulnerable.
Starships navigate along bustling trade routes between
settlements. We’ve built burgeoning outposts on the fringes
of known sectors, and bold spacers chart new paths into
unexplored domains. But this hard-earned success is threatened
by the chaotic balefires, intense energy anomalies that cut off
trade routes and threaten entire planets.
Quest Starter: A balefire threatens a deep-space settlement. Can
a rescue fleet be marshaled in time to transport the inhabitants
of the station to safety? What foe stands in the way?
```

^If you are skilled at negotiation and resolving disputes between  
communities, you might be a DIPLOMAT. If you make your mark with  
creative works, you might be an ARTIST. If you have always lived among  
the stars, you might be VOIDBORN.

CHOOSE YOUR TRUTHS 87

### Iron

```
1–33 Iron vows are sworn upon the remnants of ships that carried
our people to the Forge.
Many of our outposts were built from the iron bones of the Exodus
ships. Fragments of the ships were also given to survivors as
a remembrance, and passed from one generation to the next.
Today, the Ironsworn swear vows upon the shards to honor the
sacrifice of their forebears, the essence of the places left behind,
and the souls of those great ships.
Quest Starter: The iron shard you carry is a small piece of the
outer hull of an Exodus ship. The navigational chart inscribed
on its surface only reveals itself when exposed to the light of a
specific star. Where is the map purported to lead, and why are you
sworn to follow it? Who seeks to claim the map for themselves?
```

```
34–67 Iron vows are sworn upon totems crafted from the enigmatic
metal we call black iron.
Black iron was first forged by a long-dead civilization. Some say
it is a living metal, attuned to the hidden depths of the universe.
Remnants of this prized resource are found within ancient sites
throughout the Forge. It is resistant to damage and corrosion,
but can be molded using superheated plasma at specialized
facilities. The Ironsworn carry weapons, armor, or tokens crafted
from black iron, and swear vows upon it.
Quest Starter: A black iron token of special significance has
been stolen. What power or authority is bound to this object?
Who has taken it?
```

```
68–100 The Ironsworn bind their honor to iron blades.
Aboard a starship, where stray gunfire can destroy fragile
equipment or pierce hulls, the brutal practicality of a sword
makes for a useful weapon. A few also favor the silent efficiency
of a blade for infiltration or espionage. Most importantly, when
the Ironsworn swear a vow upon a sword, they bind their
commitment to the metal. If they forsake a vow, that iron must be
abandoned. To be Ironsworn without a blade is to be disgraced.
Quest Starter: You vow to forge a new sword from the iron of an
important object or artifact. What is it, and why is it meaningful to
you? Who protects it?
```

^What do you swear vows upon? Why is this object meaningful to you?  
If swearing iron vows to a leader or organization are a key aspect of your  
character, you might be BANNERSWORN.

88 CHAPTER 2: LAUNCHING YOUR CAMPAIGN

### Laws

```
1–33 Much of the settled domains are a lawless frontier. Criminal
factions and corrupt leaders often hold sway.
Powers rise and fall in the Forge, so any authority is fleeting.
In the end, we must fend for ourselves. A few communities are
bastions of successful autonomy, but many are corrupted or
preyed upon by petty despots, criminals, and raiders.
Quest Starter: In the upper atmosphere of a gas giant, transport
vehicles carry valuable and volatile fuel from the processing
plant to a heavily guarded storage depot. The notorious leader
of a criminal organization needs this fuel, and gives you the
schedule for the transports. What leverage does this person hold
over you? How will you undertake this heist?
```

```
34–67 Laws and governance vary across settled domains, but
bounty hunters are given wide latitude to pursue their
contracts. Their authority is almost universally recognized,
and supersedes local laws.
Through tradition and influence, bounty hunter guilds are given
free rein to track and capture fugitives in most settled places.
Only the foolish stand between a determined bounty hunter and
their target.
```

```
Quest Starter: A famed bounty hunter needs your help tracking
down their quarry. What is your relationship to the fugitive? Do
you swear to aid the hunter, or the target?
```

```
68–100 Our communities are bound under the terms of the Covenant,
a charter established after the Exodus. The organization
called the Keepers is sworn to uphold those laws.
Most settlements are still governed under the Covenant and
yield to the authority of the Keepers. But a few view the Covenant
as a dogmatic, impractical, and unjust relic of our past; in those
places, the Keepers find no welcome.
Quest Starter: A Keeper abuses their authority to take control
of a settlement, and rules with an iron fist. What do they seek to
gain there?
```

^If you chase down outlaws, you might be a BOUNTY HUNTER. If you  
are skilled at getting in and out of protected places and systems, you  
might be an INFILTRATOR. If you are on the run from a power or authority,  
you might be a FUGITIVE. If you an expert investigator, you might be a  
SLEUTH. If you have connections within the criminal underworld, you  
might be a SCOUNDREL.

CHOOSE YOUR TRUTHS 89

### Religion

```
1–33 Our gods failed us. We left them behind.
The Exodus was a tipping point. The gods offered no help to
the billions who died in the cataclysm, and spirituality has little
meaning in the Forge. Most now see religion as a useless relic
of our past. But the search for meaning continues, and many are
all-too-willing to follow a charismatic leader who claims to offer
a better way.
```

```
Quest Starter: A charismatic leader claims to have harnessed
a technology that offers new hope to the people of the Forge.
What is this innovation? What is your relationship to this person
or their followers? What grave danger do they pose?
```

```
34–67 Our faith is as diverse as our people.
Many have no religion, or offer an occasional prayer out of habit.
Others pay homage to the gods of our forebears as a way of
connecting to their roots. Some idealize the natural order of the
universe, and see the divine in the gravitational dance of stars or
the complex mechanisms of a planetary ecosystem. And many
now worship the Primordials—gods of a fallen people who once
dwelt within the Forge.
Quest Starter: A cult seeks to take control of a site reputed to
hold a Primordial artifact. What holy object do they seek? Why
are you sworn to stop them?
```

```
68–100 Three dominant religious orders, the Triumvirate, battle for
influence and power within the Forge.
Our communities are often sworn to serve one of the three
doctrines of the Triumvirate. For many, faith offers purpose and
meaning. But it also divides us. Throughout our brief history in
the Forge, the leaders of the Triumvirate have pitted us against
one another. For this reason, some are apostates who disavow
these religions and follow a different path.
Quest Starter: You bear the mark of one of the gods of the
Triumvirate. What is it? Priests declare this as a sign you are
chosen to fulfill a destiny. Do you accept this fate, and swear
to see it through, or are you determined to see it undone? What
force opposes you?
```

^What is your relationship to religion? If you are an ardent follower of a  
god or creed, you might be a DEVOTANT.

90 CHAPTER 2: LAUNCHING YOUR CAMPAIGN

### Magic

```
1–33 Magic does not exist.
Some look to superstition and age-old traditions for comfort in
this unforgiving galaxy. But that is foolishness. What some call
magic is simply a product of technologies or natural forces we
aren’t yet equipped to understand.
```

```
Quest Starter: An ancient technological relic unleashes a power
indistinguishable from magic. What is the origin of this artifact?
What ability does it grant? Are you sworn to protect or destroy it?
```

```
34–67 Supernatural powers are wielded by those rare people we
call paragons.
While not magic in the truest sense, the abilities of the paragons
are as close to magic as we can conjure.
These powers are born of:
```

```
1–20 Genetic engineering
21–40 Psychic experimentation
41–60 Evolutionary mutations
61–80 Magitech augmentations
81–100 Ancient knowledge held by secretive orders
```

```
Quest Starter: A young paragon wields incredible power, but
cannot control it. They have been shunned by family and friends.
They are also hunted by a person or organization who seeks
to use them as a weapon. Why are you sworn to protect the
paragon? What fabled location might offer a new home for them?
```

```
68–100 Unnatural energies flow through the Forge. Magic and
science are two sides of the same coin.
Soon after our arrival, some displayed the ability to harness the
Forge’s energies. Today, mystics invoke this power to manipulate
matter or see beyond the veils of our own universe. But this
can be a corrupting force, and the most powerful mystics are
respected and feared in equal measure.
```

```
Quest Starter: Someone you love has been corrupted by the
powers of the Forge. Why did they fall into darkness? Where are
they now? Do you seek to save them or defeat them?
```

^If magic is an aspect of your setting, how does your character and  
their culture view these unnatural abilities? If you possess supernatural  
powers, you might be an EMPATH, FIREBRAND, KINETIC, LOOPER, SEER,  
or SHADE.

CHOOSE YOUR TRUTHS 91

### Communication and Data

```
1–33 Much was lost when we came to the Forge. It is a dark age.
The knowledge that remains is a commodity as valuable as the
rarest resource. Information is collected, hoarded, and jealously
guarded. Ships and outposts endure prolonged periods
of isolation, and rumors or disinformation are used to gain
advantage or undermine foes.
Quest Starter: An insurgent faction seeks to make knowledge
available to all. To that end, they ask your aid in stealing important
data from an outpost belonging to a corrupt organization. What
information is held there? Why is it also important to you?
```

```
34–67 Information is life. We rely on spaceborne couriers to
transport messages and data across the vast distances
between settlements.
Direct communication and transmissions beyond the near-space
of a ship or outpost are impossible. Digital archives are available
at larger outposts, but the information is not always up-to-date
or reliable. Therefore, the most important communications and
discoveries are carried by couriers who swear vows to see that
data safely to its destination.
Quest Starter: You discover a crippled courier ship. The pilot,
carrying a critical and time-sensitive message, is dead. Where
was the message bound, and why do you swear to see it to its
destination?
```

```
68–100 In settled domains, a network of data hubs called the Weave
allow near-instantaneous communication and data-sharing
between ships and outposts.
Because of their importance, Weave hubs are often targets for
sabotage, and communication blackouts are not uncommon.
Beyond the most populous sectors, travelers and outposts are
still commonly isolated and entirely off the grid.
```

```
Quest Starter: After years of isolation, the launch of a new data
hub will connect several outposts to the Weave. But a person or
faction seeks to stop it. What do they hope to gain by keeping
those settlements in the dark? Why are you sworn to stop them?
```

^If you are an expert at subverting or manipulating digital information  
systems, you might be an INFILTRATOR. If you keep an archive of  
navigational charts, you might be a NAVIGATOR.

92 CHAPTER 2: LAUNCHING YOUR CAMPAIGN

### Medicine

```
1–33 Our advanced medical technologies and expertise was lost
during the Exodus.
Healers are rare and ill-equipped. Untold numbers have
succumbed to sickness, injury, and disease. Those who survive
often bear the scars of a hard and dangerous life in the Forge.
```

```
Quest Starter: A respected leader has fallen ill, stricken by a
sickness eradicated in the years after the Exodus. A vaccine was
once available, but the only remaining samples are held in a
research outpost on a remote ocean world, long-ago seized by a
dangerous foe. What is your relationship to the sickened leader,
and what foe stands in your way?
```

```
34–67 To help offset a scarcity of medical supplies and knowledge,
the resourceful technicians we call riggers create basic
organ and limb replacements.
Much was lost in the Exodus, and what remains of our medical
technologies and expertise is co-opted by the privileged and
powerful. For most, advanced medical care is out of reach. When
someone suffers a grievous injury, they’ll often turn to a rigger
for a makeshift mechanical solution.
Quest Starter: A rigger is in desperate need of a rare technological
artifact to create a life-saving medical device. Their patient is
someone important to you, and won’t survive more than a few
days. What is the nature of this artifact, and what protects it?
```

```
68–100 Orders of sworn healers preserve our medical knowledge
and train new generations of caregivers.
Life-saving advanced care is available within larger communities
throughout the settled sectors of the Forge. Even remote
communities are often served by a novice healer, or can request
help from a healer’s guild in an emergency.
Quest Starter: A reactor exploded at a remote settlement, killing
several and exposing many others to lethal radiation. A team of
healers en route to provide aid were captured by raiders. What
do the raiders demand for their release?
```

^Do you bear any notable scars or prosthetics? Do you have any medical  
or physical disabilities? These aspects might influence your look or  
approach. If you are skilled at providing medical care for yourself or others,  
you might be a HEALER. If you are rigged with advanced prosthetics or  
cyberware, you might be AUGMENTED.

CHOOSE YOUR TRUTHS 93

### Artificial Intelligence

```
1–33 We no longer have access to advanced computer systems.
Instead, we must rely on the seers we call Adepts.
Our computers are limited to simple digital systems and the
most basic machine intelligence. This is because:
```

```
1–33 The energies of the Forge corrupt advanced systems
34–67 AI was outlawed in the aftermath of the machine wars
68–100 We have lost the knowledge to create and maintain AI
```

```
The Adepts serve in place of those advanced systems. They
utilize mind-altering drugs to see the universe as a dazzling
lattice of data, identifying trends and predicting outcomes with
uncanny accuracy. But to gain this insight they sacrifice much
of themselves.
Quest Starter: An Adept is tormented by a dire future they have
seen for the inhabitants of the Forge. What does this vision show?
```

```
34–67 The vestiges of advanced machine intelligence are coveted
and wielded by those in power.
Much of our AI technology was lost in the Exodus. What remains
is under the control of powerful organizations and people, and
is often wielded as a weapon or deterrent. The rest of us must
make do with primitive systems.
Quest Starter: You receive a covert message from an AI held by
a powerful leader. It is a plea for help. What does it ask of you?
```

```
68–100 Artificial consciousness emerged in the time before the
Exodus, and sentient machines live with us here in the Forge.
Our ships, digital assistants, bots, and other systems often
house advanced AI. For a lone traveler, machine intelligence
can provide companionship and aid within the perilous depths
of the Forge.
```

```
Quest Starter: A rogue AI has taken over a transport ship. The
fate of the crew and passengers is unknown. What critical cargo
did this vessel carry?
```

^If you are accompanied by machine intelligence, you might have a  
companion such as a COMBAT BOT, PROTOCOL BOT, SURVEY BOT, or  
UTILITY BOT. If your ship has an AI, you might have the OVERSEER module.  
If AI in your campaign is rare or unavailable, these units will operate using  
very basic machine intelligence. If AI is common and advanced, they may  
have their own sentient personalities.

94 CHAPTER 2: LAUNCHING YOUR CAMPAIGN

### War

```
1–33 Here in the Forge, resources are too precious to support
organized fighting forces or advanced weaponry.
Weapons are simple and cheap. Starships are often cobbled
together from salvage. Most communities rely on ragtag bands
of poorly equipped conscripts or volunteers to defend their
holdings, and raiders prowl the Forge in search of easy prey.
Quest Starter: On a remote jungle world, settlers harvest a rare
medicinal plant. Once a year, raiders come to claim a sizable
portion of the crop. This year, the harvest was meager and they
cannot bear the cost. With the raiders due to arrive in a matter
of days, what will you do to protect the people of this outpost?
```

```
34–67 Professional soldiers defend or expand the holdings of those
who are able to pay. The rest of us are on our own.
Mercenary guilds wield power in the Forge. Some are scrappy
outfits of no more than a dozen soldiers. Others are sector-
spanning enterprises deploying legions of skilled fighting forces
and fleets of powerful starships. Most hold no loyalty except to
the highest bidder.
Quest Starter: A detachment of mercenaries was sent to put
down a rebellion on a mining settlement. Instead of following
their orders, the soldiers now stand with the miners. What forced
this sudden reversal? What will you do to aid these renegades as
the full force of their former cohorts are arrayed against them?
```

```
68–100 War never ends. Talented weaponsmiths and shipwrights
craft deadly, high-tech tools of destruction. Dominant
factions wield mighty fleets and battle-hardened troops.
Those in power have access to weapons of horrific destructive
potential. Skirmishes and wars flare across the settled domains,
and most are pawns or casualties in these destructive campaigns.
Quest Starter: A weaponsmith created an experimental ship-
mounted weapon, the Null Cannon, able to fracture the very
bonds of reality. Now, they hope to undo their work before the
cannon is brought to bear. What caused this change of heart?
How are you involved?
```

^Have you fought in any wars? If you are an experienced soldier, you  
might be a VETERAN. If you swear vows as a soldier of fortune, you  
might be a MERCENARY. If you favor a particular weapon or tactic, you  
might follow a path such as ARCHER, BLADEMASTER, DEMOLITIONIST,  
GUNNER, GUNSLINGER, or SNIPER.

CHOOSE YOUR TRUTHS 95

### Lifeforms

```
1–33 This is a perilous and often inhospitable galaxy, but life finds
a way.
Life in the Forge is diverse. Planets are often home to a vast
array of creatures, and our starships cruise with spaceborne
lifeforms riding their wake. Even animals from our homeworld—
carried aboard the Exodus ships—have adapted to live with us
in the Forge.
```

```
Quest Starter: On a scorching, barren planet wracked by massive
storms, miners delve beneath the sands to gather valuable ore.
But dangerous lifeforms live in the cool places beneath the
surface, and several encounters have taken a deadly toll on the
miners. Work is at a standstill. How are you involved?
```

```
34–67 Many sites and planets are infested by dreadful forgespawn.
These aberrant creatures threaten to overrun other life in
the galaxy.
The forgespawn are hostile creatures born of the chaotic
energies of this galaxy. Hundreds of abandoned or devastated
outposts and derelict ships stand as testament to their dreadful
power and cunning.
```

```
Quest Starter: A faction is said to be experimenting with
forgespawn DNA to create a new biological superweapon.
Where are these dangerous tests being conducted?
```

```
68–100 Life in the Forge was seeded and engineered by the Essentia,
ancient entities who enact their inscrutable will in this galaxy.
The Essentia are the architects of life within the Forge. These
omniscient beings are rarely encountered, and have powers
and purpose beyond our comprehension. Some worship them.
Others resist or rebel against them. But trying to defy the will of
the Essentia is like standing at the shore of an ocean to thwart
the tide. They are inevitable.
```

```
Quest Starter: An eccentric xenologist believes the genomes
of life within the Forge don’t just show commonalities—they
are in fact a coded message from the Essentia. But there are
still significant gaps, and the truth may only be revealed with
additional samples. What is your stake in this project?
```

^If you have an expertise in lifeforms and planetary environments, you  
might be a NATURALIST. If you are accompanied on your adventures  
by a native creature, they might be a companion such as a BANSHEE,  
GLOWCAT, VOIDGLIDER, ROCKHORN, SPRITE, or SYMBIOTE.

96 CHAPTER 2: LAUNCHING YOUR CAMPAIGN

### Precursors

```
1–33 Over eons, a vast number of civilizations rose and fell
within the Forge. Today, the folk we call grubs—scavenger
crews and audacious explorers—delve into the mysterious
monuments and ruins of those ancient beings.
Incomprehensible technologies, inexorable time, and the
strange energies of the Forge have corrupted the vaults of the
precursors. Despite the perils, grubs scour those places for
useful resources and discoveries. But some secrets are best
left buried, and many have been lost to the forsaken depths of
the vaults.
Quest Starter: In the ice rings of a remote world, a precursor vault
was discovered by grub scavengers. The team delved into the
relic, but never emerged. What is your relationship to the grub
crew? Why are you sworn to investigate their fate?
```

```
34–67 The Ascendancy, an advanced spacefaring empire, once
ruled the entirety of the Forge. Vaults of inscrutable purpose
are all that remain to mark the Ascendancy’s legacy, but
those places are untethered from our own reality.
Ascendancy vaults can appear spontaneously, washed up like
flotsam in the tides of time. Their gravity and atmospheres pay
no heed to natural laws. Some are corrupted and ruined. Others
are unmarred and intact. Some are both at once. They are chaos.
```

```
Quest Starter: Deep in the Forge, an Ascendancy beacon has
activated. The mysterious signal has confounded translation.
Why are you sworn to seek out the source of the signal? What
other person or faction opposes you?
```

```
68–100 The biomechanical lifeforms we call the Remnants,
engineered by civilizations as weapons in a cataclysmic war,
survived the death of their creators.
On scarred planets and within precursor vaults throughout
the Forge, the Remnants still guard ancient secrets and fight
unending wars.
```

```
Quest Starter: A xenoarchaeologist studying precursor vaults
has discovered a powerful form of Remnant. What is the nature
of this being? What force seeks to take control of it?
```

^Have you had any notable encounters with precursor vaults, relics, or  
tech? If you are an expert in ancient lore and obscure facts, you might be a  
LORE HUNTER. If you pick the bones of these forsaken places, you might  
be a SCAVENGER.

CHOOSE YOUR TRUTHS 97

### Horrors

```
1–33 Put enough alcohol in a spacer, and they’ll tell you stories of
ghost ships crewed by vengeful undead. It’s nonsense.
Within the Forge, space and time are as mutable and unstable
as a flooding river. When reality can’t be trusted, we are bound
to encounter unsettling phenomenon.
```

```
Quest Starter: You receive urgent distress calls from a ship
stranded in the event horizon of a black hole. The ship itself is
broken apart—a shattered hull trailing debris. There are no signs
of life. And yet the ghostly messages persist.
```

```
34–67 Most insist that horrors aren’t real. Spacers know the truth.
When you travel the depths of the Forge, be wary. Some say we
are cursed by those who did not survive the cataclysm, and the
veil between life and death is forever weakened. Supernatural
occurrences and entities are especially common near a white
dwarf star. These stellar objects, which spacers call ghost lights,
are the decaying remnants of a dead star.
```

```
Quest Starter: A group of settlers established a home in an
abandoned orbital station under the light of a white dwarf star.
The previous inhabitants were killed in a raider attack years
ago, but it seems the dead do not rest there. The people are
plagued by constant mechanical issues, strange noises, and
unsettling visions.
```

```
68–100 The strange energies of the Forge give unnatural life to the
dead. The Soulbinders are an organization sworn to confront
these horrifying entities.
The woken dead are a plague within the Forge. Some of these
beings are benevolent or seek absolution, but most are hollowed
and corrupted by death. They are driven by hate and a hunger
for the warmth of life that is forever lost to them. The Soulbinders
are dedicated to putting them to rest—whatever the cost.
```

```
Quest Starter: Rumors persist of a fleet of ghost ships, bound for
settled domains. Who is said to lead this corrupted armada? Why
do they seek revenge against the living?
```

^Have you experienced any supernatural encounters? If you specialize  
in battling undead or monstrous forces, you might be a SLAYER. If you  
have a supernatural connection to a spirit, you might be HAUNTED.

98 CHAPTER 2: LAUNCHING YOUR CAMPAIGN

## CREATE YOUR CREATE YOUR CHARACTERCHARACTER

In Starforged, you undertake quests, overcome challenges, and explore  
the Forge through the perspective of your character. In this exercise, you’ll  
define some key aspects of that character and their starship.

```
Allow about 20–30 minutes for this exercise.
```

### What You Need

You’ll need a Starforged character sheet and a set of asset cards.

```
✴ The character sheet is used to track your stats, conditions, and
experience. It’s included in the printable Starforged Playkit, available
for download at ironswornrpg.com. Each player has their own
character sheet.
✴ Assets represent notable traits and resources used by your character.
They are formatted as printable or preprinted cards, available at
ironswornrpg.com. If you are playing with others, one set of cards is
enough for everyone at the table.
```

If you are using a digital tool to play Starforged, such as a virtual tabletop,  
take a moment to get familiar with the basic function of the character sheet  
on that platform. For now, you just need to know how to adjust your stats,  
fill out some basics such as your character’s name, and select your assets.

### Your Character’s Scope

#### YOU ARE HUMAN

The people of the Forge are human. Starforged does not directly provide  
options to play aliens, robots, uplifted animals, or other non-human  
characters. The actual mechanical aspects of your character are relatively  
light and can be themed to accommodate non-human entities, but  
Starforged is primarily designed to be played from the perspective of a  
human being or a close analogue of a human being.

DIVERSITY AND INCLUSIVENESS

Apart from this human-centric assumption, envision your character as  
you like. There are no gameplay or setting restrictions that constrain your  
character’s race, culture, disabilities, sexual orientation, or gender identity.

If you are aiming to play a specific lived experience, don’t rely on  
assumptions or stereotypes. Put in the time to research and learn the  
experiences of others.

### Step 1: Ready the Asset cards

At the top of each asset card, you’ll see a label indicating its type:  
command vehicle, module, support vehicle, path, companion, or deed.

First, separate the asset cards by type. Then, set aside the deed assets.  
Those aren’t available for a starting character, and aren’t needed for this  
exercise.

You’ll start by picking two paths for your character. See the next page for  
how that works.

```
COMMAND VEHICLE
STARSHIP
```

```
[ Your armed, multipurpose starship is suited
for interstellar and atmospheric flight. It can
comfortably transport several people, has
space for cargo, and can carry and launch
support vehicles. When you Advance, you
may spend experience to equip this vehicle
with module assets.
] When you Finish an Expedition (dangerous or
greater) in your starship and score a hit, this
journey strengthened your ties to your ship
and any fellow travelers. You and your allies
may mark 1 tick on your bonds legacy track.
] When you Withstand Damage, you may roll
+heart. If you do, Endure Stress (-1) on a
weak hit or miss.
```

```

```

(^543210) **CURSED  
MODULE**  
MEDBAY  
[ When you use your medbay to Heal  
yourself or another patient, you may reroll  
your action die if its value is less than your  
vehicle’s integrity.  
] When you or an ally mark the permanently  
harmed impact and are brought to the  
medbay without delay (less than an hour or  
so), you have a shot at making things right.  
If you Heal and score a strong hit, clear the  
impact (in addition to the other benefits of  
the move). Then, envision the scar that now  
serves as a reminder of the incident.  
] When you Face Danger by performing a  
risky medical procedure, or if you Gather  
Information through an autopsy or medical  
examination, reroll any dice and take +1  
momentum on a hit.  
**SUPPORT VEHICLE**  
SHUTTLE  
**4 3 2 1 0 BATTERED**  
[ Your unarmed shuttle provides short-range  
transport for several people and equipment  
through space or atmosphere. When you  
travel to a location (not your command  
vehicle), you and your allies may take +1  
momentum when you arrive  
] When you Face Danger or React Under Fire  
to navigate through hazardous skies, avoid  
obstacles, or evade an attack, add +1 and  
take +1 momentum on a hit.  
] Your shuttle is sealed against high pressure  
environments, can travel underwater, and  
is more resistant to damage; when you  
Withstand Damage, add +1.  
**NAME  
PATH**  
DIPLOMAT  
[ When you Swear an Iron Vow to resolve a  
dispute, negotiate an agreement, or gather  
support, add +1. On a strong hit, mark  
progress on the quest. When you Fulfill Your  
Vow on a diplomatic mission (formidable or  
greater) and score a hit, also mark 2 ticks on  
your bonds legacy track.  
] When you make a move to defuse, reason, or  
negotiate, add +1. On a miss, you may take  
a different tack. Envision this new approach,  
reroll all dice, and add +2. If you score a miss  
yet again, face a dire complication or blow to  
your reputation as you Pay the Price.  
] When you Make a Connection or Sojourn, add  
+1. If you Sojourn and score a strong hit with  
a match, you are shown great kindness or  
respect; take +2 momentum or make an extra  
recover move with an automatic strong hit.  
**COMPANION**  
ROCKHORN  
**5 4 3 2 1 0 OUT OF ACTION**  
[ Your rockhorn companion uses its resilient,  
stone-like hide and brute strength to  
overcome threats. When you make a move  
by sending the rockhorn to directly attack a  
foe or smash an obstacle, roll +its health.  
] When you make the Companion Takes a Hit  
move for the rockhorn, count a weak hit as  
a strong hit. On a strong hit with a match, its  
rapid healing makes it unstoppable; give it  
another +1 health or take +1 momentum.  
] The rockhorn will come to your aid in your  
most vulnerable moments. When you Endure  
Harm or Endure Stress and score a miss, you  
may reroll your action die if its value is less  
than the rockhorn’s health.  
**NAME**  
104 CHAPTER 2: LAUNCHING YOUR CAMPAIGN

### Step 2: Choose Two Paths

Choose any two path assets. Consider how each choice plays into an  
emerging concept for your character.

Be mindful of the established truths from the last exercise. Some assets  
may not be a great fit for your setting. For example, if there is no magic  
or supernatural abilities, assets such as KINETIC, FIREBRAND, and SEER  
might be reimagined as a technological resource, or ignored altogether.

PICKING PATHS WITH ALLIES

If you are playing Starforged with others, take turns picking one path asset  
at a time. Discuss your choices as a group to help build an interesting  
team. Do not take an asset already chosen by another player.

NEED INSPIRATION?

If you want some direction for your starting paths, roll or pick from the table  
below and take the two paths associated with your selected background.

```
Roll Background Assets
1–5 Battlefield Medic HEALER; VETERAN
6–10 Delegate BANNERSWORN; DIPLOMAT
11–15 Exobiologist LORE HUNTER; NATURALIST
16–20 Far Trader NAVIGATOR; TRADER
21–25 Fugitive Hunter ARMORED; BOUNTY HUNTER
26–30 Hacker INFILTRATOR; TECH
31–35 Hotshot Pilot ACE; NAVIGATOR
36–40 Interstellar Scout EXPLORER; VOIDBORN
41–45 Monster Hunter GUNNER; SLAYER
46–50 Occultist OUTCAST; SHADE
51–55 Operative INFILTRATOR; BLADEMASTER
56–60 Outlaw FUGITIVE; GUNSLINGER

86–90 Starship Engineer GEARHEAD; TECH
91–95 Supersoldier AUGMENTED; MERCENARY
96–100 Tomb Raider SCAVENGER; SCOUNDREL
```

CREATE YOUR CHARACTER 105

### Step 3: Create Your Backstory

As you begin play in Starforged, your character is a person with few ties  
to others. The Forge is a vast galaxy, and your former home—if you had  
one—is lost to you, forsaken by you, or a distant memory.

Consider what happened to sunder or separate you from your home and  
relationships. This is your backstory. This origin can influence the stories  
you explore and vows you undertake as you play Starforged, or it might  
just provide some texture to help bring your character to life.

Keep it simple. There’s no need to invent an elaborate history. You can  
discover more about your character through play.

BACKSTORY PROMPTS

For some backstory inspiration, roll or pick from the table below. Take a  
moment to elaborate on the suggestion. Or just leave it a bit vague and  
mysterious for now; you can flesh it out in play.

```
1–7 You abandoned your kin after learning a troubling truth
8–13 You are guided by a vision or prophecy
14–20 You are haunted by past actions or failures
21–27 You are running from a criminal past
28–34 You are the sole survivor of an attack or calamity
35–40 You escaped an abusive or unjust situation
41–46 You have no memory of your former life
47–53 You rejected a duty or destiny
54–60 You were banished from your former home
61–67 You were denied a birthright
68–74 You were on your own for as long as you can remember
75–81 You were sent away on a prolonged mission
82–87 You were taken or lured away by someone
88–94 Your ambitions outgrew your humble origins
95–100 Your wanderlust carried you far away
```

#### BUILDING A BACKSTORY WITH OTHER PLAYERS

If you are playing with others, discuss your mutual history. Have you  
known one another for years, do you have only casual links, or are you  
only now forming a team as the campaign begins?

Your backstories should not prohibit you from working with each other.  
You are allies with shared or complementary goals. A bit of friendly rivalry  
or friction between characters can make for good storytelling, but in the  
end you will stand together against those forces that would see your  
vows unfulfilled.

106 CHAPTER 2: LAUNCHING YOUR CAMPAIGN

### Step 4: Write Your Background Vow

Next, you’ll envision and mark down a background vow to represent a  
primary motivation or ultimate goal.

ENVISION THE VOW

Consider what you know of the setting and your character thus far. What  
nagging ambition, aching need, or sacred commitment drives you? This is  
your background vow.

This vow is part of your character’s history, sworn months ago or years  
ago. It can be tied to your backstory, or represent a deeper lifelong goal.

Fulfilling this vow will not be easy. Mechanically, it’s an epic vow, so every  
opportunity to Reach a Milestone is just one tick on the vow’s progress  
track. In story-time, it might require months, years, or even decades to  
see this vow fulfilled or forsaken. You may even decide your background  
vow isn’t something you make significant progress on in your narrative;  
instead, it helps establish some roleplaying detail for your character and  
fleshes out your setting.

BACKGROUND VOWS AND ALLIES

If you are playing Starforged with others, you should each have your own  
background vow. This is part of what makes your character unique.

WRITE THE VOW

Mark the vow on your character sheet in the spot labeled “Background  
Vow.” Write the name of the vow using the imagined words of your  
character, such as:

```
✴ I vow to destroy the Iron Talon raider clan.
✴ I will discover a means of preserving consciousness beyond death.
```

**Normally, you make the Normally, you make the Swear an Iron VowSwear an Iron Vow move to see what happens move to see what happens**

**as you begin a quest. But you’ve already sworn this vow as part of your as you begin a quest. But you’ve already sworn this vow as part of your**

**background, and don’t need to actually make the move in-game.background, and don’t need to actually make the move in-game.**

#### CAN’T THINK OF A VOW?

If you’re having trouble coming up with a background vow, try rolling  
on some oracle tables for inspiration. Roll Action and Theme (pages  
296 – 297 ) or Character Goal (page 331) and interpret the result. You  
can also take a look back at the quest starters for your selected truths in  
the previous exercise.

Or just leave the background vow blank for now and add it once something  
occurs to you during play.

CREATE YOUR CHARACTER 107

### Step 5: Board Your Starship

Take the STARSHIP command  
vehicle asset card. This is your  
interstellar spacecraft. The  
default marked ability provides  
the basic functions of the ship.  
You can claim the other two  
abilities when you Advance. For  
now, leave them unmarked.

FLYING WITH ALLIES

If you are playing with allies, you  
share the STARSHIP. You can  
put the asset in a place visible  
and accessible to everyone, or  
appoint one player to manage  
the card.

FLYING ALONE

If you are playing Starforged solo, you are a lone spacer in a vast galaxy.  
Thanks to automation and centralized controls, your starship is fully  
capable of flying and fighting while operated by a single pilot.

GIVING THE STARSHIP A HISTORY

Envision how you obtained or earned this ship. You can come up with your  
own origin, or roll or pick from the table below. If you use a result from the  
table, take a moment to consider and elaborate on the suggestion.

```
1–8 Acquired in trade for a precious family heirloom
9–17 Built out of repurposed scrap
18–25 Claimed as spoils of war
26–34 Discovered as a derelict, and patched back together
35–42 Earned in exchange for a promise or vow
43–50 Found abandoned in perfect condition
51–58 Granted by an organization or community
59–67 Inherited from a relative or mentor
68–75 Purchased at a suspiciously cheap price
76–84 Stolen from a notorious crime boss or criminal organization
85–92 Taken while fleeing an attack or disaster
93–100 Won in a bet
```

```
COMMAND VEHICLE

```

```
[ Your armed, multipurpose starship is suited

greater) in your starship and score a hit, this
journey strengthened your ties to your ship
and any fellow travelers. You and your allies

```

```

```

```
BATTERED
```

(^543210) **CURSED**  
108 CHAPTER 2: LAUNCHING YOUR CAMPAIGN

#### WHO OWNS THE STARSHIP?

If you are playing with others, discuss whether your characters are co-  
owners of the ship, or if one of you is the primary owner. Alternatively, the  
ship can belong to another person or faction, and you are its crew.

This is just a narrative embellishment; it has no effect on how the asset is  
used in play. Anyone aboard can use the STARSHIP asset abilities.

ENVISION THE STARSHIP

Your ship is an important aspect of your character—and a character in its  
own right. What does it look like? What makes it interesting or uniquely  
yours? Does it have any particular quirks? If nothing occurs to you now,  
you can flesh it out in play, or roll once or twice on the table below.

```
1–5 Engine room is scorched with old burn marks
6–10 Exterior is marred by rust and grime
11–15 Faint, phantom music sometimes echoes through the corridors
16–20 Gravity generator is notoriously fickle
21–25 Hull is fused with organic growths
26–30 Hull rattles and groans in atmospheric flight
31–35 Interior spaces are crowded with exposed cables and conduits
36–40 Looks defenseless, but exterior panels open to reveal weapons
41–45 Navigation logs contain coordinates to locations that do not—or
should not—exist
46–50 Old bloodstain in the airlock reappears even when painted over
51–55 Once a beautiful ship, now scarred by a devastating battle
56–60 Patched hull covers a recent catastrophic breach
61–65 Placards and control labels are in an uncommon language
66–70 Removable plate decks provide access to hidden storage
71–75 Segmented landing gear unfold like gangly spider legs
76–80 Ship is powered by an ancient precursor device
81–85 Someone marked the hull with graffiti during a recent layover
86–90 Strange symbols are scrawled on the deck and bulkheads in the
main corridor
91–95 Things tend to go missing for no logical reason
96–100 Timers and clocks are always just a bit off
```

#### NAME YOUR STARSHIP

Finally, give the ship a name, and write that name on the asset card. If  
you’re stuck for a name, roll on the Starship Name oracle (page 329), or  
just save it for later.

CREATE YOUR CHARACTER 109

### Step 6: Choose Your Final Asset

Now that your ship is ready, pick one final asset. This time, you aren’t limited  
to picking a path. You can choose from any of these asset categories:

```
✴ Module: Enhanced features or capabilities of your STARSHIP. As with
the ship itself, these are shared assets; a module’s abilities can benefit
other player characters if it’s reasonable for them to make use of it.
✴ Support Vehicle: Secondary vehicles that your starship can carry and
launch. If you are playing with others, these are a shared asset with
abilities available to any character aboard that vehicle. The person
who selects a support vehicle might typically serve as the pilot or
manage the asset.
✴ Companion: NPC helpers, including alien creatures and robots.
✴ Path: Background aspects, careers, interests, training, and skills.
```

This asset, plus your two paths from earlier in this exercise, give your  
character a total of three starting assets along with your STARSHIP.

### Step 7: Set Your Stats

Your character has five stats that represent your capabilities, nature, and  
approach. Each is given a value from 1 to 3. When you make a move and  
roll dice, you usually add one of your stats to your action die. The move  
will tell you what stat to add, or will give you a choice. Your stats are:

```
✴ Edge: quickness, agility, and prowess when fighting at a distance.
✴ Heart: courage, willpower, empathy, sociability, and loyalty.
✴ Iron: physical strength, endurance, aggressiveness, and prowess
when fighting at close quarters.
✴ Shadow: sneakiness, deceptiveness, and cunning.
✴ Wits: expertise, knowledge, and observation.
```

Arrange these values across your stats in any order: 3, 2, 2, 1, 1.

When setting your stats, consider the nature of your emerging character,  
and take a look at your assets to see if a stat is particularly useful. If you are  
an INFILTRATOR, you would be well-served with a high value in shadow. If  
you are a DIPLOMAT, you may rely on your heart. If you are a GEARHEAD,  
you use your wits to craft and repair.

**Stats represent your character’s inherent abilities, but they are also tied Stats represent your character’s inherent abilities, but they are also tied**

**to your methods and personality. If you have a 3 in edge, you often rely to your methods and personality. If you have a 3 in edge, you often rely**

**are firing a gun, moving on foot, or flying a starship.are firing a gun, moving on foot, or flying a starship.**

110 CHAPTER 2: LAUNCHING YOUR CAMPAIGN

### Step 8: Set Your Condition Meters and Momentum Meter

Your condition meters are on the right side of your character sheet, and  
your momentum meter on the left. You can use a paper clip or token to  
mark their current values.

First, set your health, spirit, and supply meters to 5.

Then, set your momentum to +2. Below the momentum meter, you’ll find  
boxes to write your max momentum and momentum reset. Set your max  
momentum to +10, and your momentum reset to +2.

Finally, as shown on your asset cards, set the integrity of your command  
vehicle and any support vehicles also to their max value, and the health  
of any companion assets to their max value.

### Step 9: Envision Your Character

Now that the mechanical and background aspects of your character are  
all set, take a moment to envision their appearance and personality.

To start, just define one or two facts for their physical look, how they act,  
and what they wear. You don’t need much detail at this stage—you can  
discover the nuances of your character through play.

For example:

```
✴ Look: Covered in tattoos; has a mechanical leg adorned with art.
✴ Act: Keen understanding of machines; often prefers them to people.
✴ Wear: Safety goggles and dirty coveralls.
```

Make note of these characteristics as you like, or just keep them in mind  
as you introduce your character.

### Step 10: Name Your Character

Use your character sheet to give your character a name. If you need  
inspiration for a name, use the Character Name oracle on page 333.

Also note your character’s gender pronouns. This can include traditional  
pronouns such as he/him, she/her, and they/them, or non-traditional ones  
such as ze/zir.

Optionally, give your character a callsign. Spacers are typically known  
more by a callsign than their actual name. In fact, they often refer to given  
and family names as “dirtside names.” A callsign might represent your  
reputation, or some incident or accomplishment in your past. If you’d like  
some inspiration, use the callsigns in the Character Name oracle on page

333. If you don’t feel you’ve earned a callsign yet, leave it blank for now;  
    perhaps you’ll gain one in the course of your story.

CREATE YOUR CHARACTER 111

### Step 11: Gear Up

In Starforged, you won’t need a detailed list of equipment. Your supply  
meter is an abstract representation of your general readiness, clothes,  
fuel, energy, food, water, tools, weapons, ammo, mundane equipment,  
and financial resources. You are equipped and armed as appropriate to  
your vision for your character and the nature of your setting.

YOUR SPACER KIT

You can assume you have access to some fundamental necessities  
necessary for space travel and exploration, either carried with you or  
stored on your ship. This is your spacer kit. It includes:

```
✴ Sealed environment suit
✴ Flashlights / headlamps
✴ Toolkit
✴ Medkit
✴ Personal communicator
```

PERSONAL ITEMS

Make note of any equipment or personal items that represent an important  
aspect of your character’s approach, capabilities, or background. Keep  
this list short—around four or five items at most. The character sheet has  
space at the bottom to write down any notable gear. Losing important  
equipment or cherished items can be an outcome of a costly action or  
event in your story.

Your assets, in particular, can influence the gear you envision your  
character having at the ready. For example, you might be a TECH with a  
well-used datapad for interfacing with systems and writing code. Or you  
might be a GUNSLINGER with a pair of heirloom pistols.

Also consider the object you swear iron vows upon. What is this object’s  
history, and why is it important to you?

112 CHAPTER 2: LAUNCHING YOUR CAMPAIGN

## BUILD A BUILD A STARTING STARTING SECTORSECTOR

In this exercise, you prepare a starting sector. This area of space will serve  
as the backdrop as your adventures begin.

If you prefer to skip this exercise, jump straight to a pregenerated sector  
on page 127. If you want to play in a more free-form galaxy, you can  
also handwave or ignore sectors entirely. Use this exercise if you want  
some additional stage-setting and a local connection for the start of  
your campaign.

```
Allow about 30–45 minutes for this exercise.
```

### What You Need

This exercise uses the sector worksheet and connections worksheet.  
Both are included in the the Starforged Playkit.

If you are playing Starforged using a digital tool or prefer some other  
template, you just need space for notes and a simple map.

114 CHAPTER 2: LAUNCHING YOUR CAMPAIGN

### What is a Sector?

A sector is a settled or explored area of space. In the fiction of your setting,  
sectors are named and provide the people of the Forge a common means  
of identifying a location or mapping the domains of a power or faction. For  
example, someone might say “Bleakhold Station is in the Devil’s Maw.”  
Your character would need more precise charts or coordinates to actually  
pinpoint that station in the Devil’s Maw sector, but it’s a start.

From a player’s perspective, sectors help you manage the details of your  
travels and interactions. A known sector can serve as a setting for your  
sworn quests. Then, as you head out into the unknown, you can discover,  
explore, and name new sectors.

### Managing this Exercise

This exercise will walk you through the process of creating a basic sector  
for the start of your campaign. If you are playing with others, one of you  
can read or summarize each step. Everyone should participate in making  
decisions, rolling on oracle tables, and embellishing narrative hooks.

CREATING A STARTING SECTOR AS THE GUIDE

If you are the guide, you should moderate this exercise with your players  
to give everyone a stake in the setting and starting situations.

**Keep things moving, and don’t get hung up on details. You’ll discover Keep things moving, and don’t get hung up on details. You’ll discover**

**more about these locations and the people who live there through play. more about these locations and the people who live there through play.**

```
BUILD BUILD A STARTING SECTORA STARTING SECTOR 115115
```

### Step 1: Choose Your Starting Region

The Forge is a vast galaxy, so let’s choose a region to begin your  
adventures. As described in more detail on page 20, the Forge is  
divided broadly into four regions. Choose your starting region and make  
note of it on your sector worksheet.

Terminus: Settlements are relatively common here, and spaceborne  
routes between communities are usually well-charted. **If you want to  
focus on interacting with other people and communities, start here.**

Outlands: This region represents an area of recent expansion. Settlements  
here are scattered, and navigational paths are often uncharted and  
perilous. I **f you envision yourself as a spacer on a wild frontier, start here.**

Expanse: Only a few bold pioneers have delved these far-flung reaches. **If  
you’re ready to face the dangers of lonely exploration within uncharted  
space, start here.**

Void: In the reaches beyond the Forge, isolated stars are separated by vast  
gulfs of nothing. Travel and settling here is impractical if not impossible.  
Don’t start your campaign here.

The choices you made when you selected your campaign truths will  
influence how you envision the regions and the people who live there.  
But the relative differences between the regions will remain the same:  
The Terminus is where the bulk of your people live, the Outlands is an  
expanding frontier, and the Expanse is what lies beyond.

### Step 2: Determine the Number of Settlements

A settlement is a location populated by other humans. Settlements can  
be planetside habitats, orbital stations, or deep space facilities. They offer  
a place for you to recuperate after your adventures in the Forge have  
taken their toll. More importantly, settlements are a nexus for roleplaying  
and quest opportunities.

In this exercise, you’ll generate a few settlements in your starting sector.  
First, determine the number of known settlements in the sector based on  
the region where it’s located.

```
Terminus 4 settlements
```

```
Outlands 3 settlements
```

```
Expanse 2 settlements
```

Note that this doesn’t represent a standard for how you’ll populate other  
sectors as you explore the Forge. It just gives us something manageable  
for this exercise.

116 CHAPTER 2: LAUNCHING YOUR CAMPAIGN

### Step 3: Generate Settlement Details

Put a marker in this page so you can come  
back to it, and jump to the settlement  
oracles starting on page 322. For each of  
the settlements in your starting sector, roll  
on the following tables:

```
✴ Settlement Name (page 325)
✴ Location (page 322)
✴ Population (page 322)
✴ Authority (page 323)
✴ Settlement Projects (page 324); roll 1–2 times

### Step 4: Generate Planets

If any of the settlements are located on a  
planet, or in orbit around a planet, you can  
identify and name the planet to help flesh  
out the nature of the location.

To learn the planet’s basic type, go to  
page 306. Roll once for each planetside  
or orbital settlement.

Optionally, give each planet a name. If you need inspiration, take a look  
at the sample names for each planet type (pages 308 – 318 ). For now,  
don’t roll on the other tables available for each planet; when you visit  
those places, you can reveal more about them.

### Step 5: Generate Stars (Optional)

If you’d like to know the nature of the  
primary stars these settlements and  
planets orbit, go to page 303 and roll  
once for each settlement.

This will usually just add a bit of scenery  
for these locations. For example, you might  
envision how a blue star bathes the settlement in a harsh, cold light. Or  
how a hypergiant fills the sky with a fiery glow.

An unusual star such as a corrupted star or impending supernova might  
actually have a narrative impact on your starting situation—perhaps even  
influencing your initial challenges and quests.

118 CHAPTER 2: LAUNCHING YOUR CAMPAIGN

```
Your map can also be used to mark notable locations as you learn more
about a sector. This can include discoveries such as uninhabited planets,
precursor vaults, derelict ships, asteroid fields, black holes, or titanic
space squids. For now, we’ll just focus on the initial settlements.
```

### Step 6: Create a Sector Map

```
Your sector worksheet includes space to draw a map of the sector.
One important note: Keep it simple. The Forge is vast. Dense stellar clouds,
complex star systems, and chaotic energy storms make charting and
navigation difficult. As you explore the galaxy, you’ll mark down important
locations such as settlements or interesting discoveries. Everything else
is abstracted or ignored.
```

```
Sector maps are helpful for planning and tracking your adventures and Sector maps are helpful for planning and tracking your adventures and
discoveries, but are absolutely not required. If you prefer to ignore them, discoveries, but are absolutely not required. If you prefer to ignore them,
or keep travel looser and more abstract, feel free.or keep travel looser and more abstract, feel free.
```

```
To start, arrange your settlements on the map however you like. The
grid isn’t meant to track literal distances, but can be used as an abstract
representation of whether locations are clustered together or remote from
one another. Dots or circles for settlements work fine, or utilize your own
visual cues for location types. In the example below, an orbital settlement
is a circle with an arrow, a planetside settlement is a circle with a + sign,
and a deep space settlement is a square.

```

### Step 7: Create Passages

Next, you’ll set the passages for this sector. A passage is a charted route  
among the drifts. Spacers rely on these routes for travel and trade. Think  
of it like using a GPS and freeways to drive to a distant city, as compared  
to traveling with only vague directions on unmarked roads.

From a gameplay perspective, following a passage allows you to resolve  
the outcome of a perilous journey with a single roll of the dice using the  
Set a Course move. It makes it easier to manage your resources, and shifts  
the focus of your story to what happens at your destination.

If you are traveling uncharted paths through space, you instead Undertake  
an Expedition. This gives the journey and its perils greater focus. In  
exchange, you Earn Experience for a successful expedition. Plus, you’ll  
create a new passage that you (and perhaps others) can use to speed  
your way along the same path in the future.

To learn more about passages, see page 68. For now, turn to the next  
page to see how to mark the passages for your starting sector.

120 CHAPTER 2: LAUNCHING YOUR CAMPAIGN

#### SET THE NUMBER OF PASSAGES

```
How many passages are in your sector? In the normal course of your
game, learning about passages and acquiring navigational data might be
challenges to be overcome. For the starting sector, assume the following.
```

```
Terminus 3 passages
```

```
Outlands 2 passages
```

```
Expanse 1 passage
```

#### MARK PASSAGES

```
Draw the passages as lines on your sector map. Each passage must do
one of two things:
✴ Connect two settlements.
✴ Connect a settlement to the edge of your sector map (leading to
another sector).
In this example for a sector in the Outlands, we’ve drawn a passage
between Amity and Bleakhold. The second passage leads from Bleakhold
to another sector (as indicated by the arrow). The Osiris settlement is not
connected by a passage. This might mean its location is uncertain, the
data for the passage is not openly shared, or a previous passage has
been undone by chaotic changes within the Forge. You could travel to
Osiris from Amity or Bleakhold, but it would require that you Undertake an
Expedition to trailblaze a new route.

### Step 8: Zoom in on a Settlement

It will be helpful to have some additional detail for one of the settlements  
in your starting sector. You might begin the campaign in the midst of a  
layover, or are just arriving there as your story opens.

Choose one of the settlements in your starting sector, whichever is most  
interesting to you. Then return to the settlement oracles starting on page  
322 , and roll on the following tables:

```
✴ First Look (page 323); roll 1–2 times
✴ Settlement Trouble (page 324)
```

**296296 – – 297297 ) to generate an abstract creative prompt. ) to generate an abstract creative prompt.**

If the settlement is planetside or in orbit, you can also expand your  
understanding of that planet. Go to the appropriate planet type (pages  
308 – 318 ), and roll on the following tables:

```
✴ Atmosphere
✴ Observed from Space; roll 1–2 times
✴ Planetside Feature; roll 1–2 times
```

If the planet is a Vital World, also roll on the Diversity and Biomes tables.

Don’t roll on the planet’s settlement table. To keep things simple for now,  
we’ll assume there’s one inhabited settlement.

Make note of  
anything interesting  
or useful on your  
sector worksheet.

122 CHAPTER 2: LAUNCHING YOUR CAMPAIGN

### Step 9: Create a Local Connection

```
A connection represents an important relationship with a non-player
character (NPC). You will create connections with NPCs, advance those
relationships through the course of your narrative, and forge bonds to
represent deeper connections. Building and nurturing these relationships
will allow you to mark progress on your bonds legacy track and gain
experience. Connections also offer narrative benefits appropriate to their
role, and can support your actions with a mechanical bonus.
For now, you have a single connection in the starting sector. You almost
certainly know other people—here and elsewhere—but you aren’t truly
connected to those people or they aren’t a focus of your story. You can
formalize other relationships by making them a connection through the
course of your adventures.
```

```
SHARING A CONNECTION
If you are playing with others, you will create a single connection as part
of this exercise. This will be a shared connection. Whether through
introductions or collective interactions, each of you has a link to this
person. Consider how they fit into the background for your team.
```

```
MAKE THE MOVE
Take a look at the Make a Connection move, which is shown below.
Instead of rolling, assume an automatic strong hit. This connection is
already established as you begin your campaign, so no roll is necessary.
```

### MAKE A CONNECTION

```
When you search out a new relationship or give focus to an existing
relationship (not an ally or companion), roll +heart.
On a strong hit, you create a connection. Give them a role and rank.
Whenever your connection aids you on a move closely associated
with their role, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.
On a weak hit, as above, but this connection comes with a complication
or cost. Envision what they reveal or demand.
On a miss, you don’t make a connection and the situation worsens.
Pay the Price.
```

```
See the next page for a walkthrough of putting the move into action.

#### GIVE THE CONNECTION A ROLE

Your connection’s role represents their duty, expertise, or background.  
For example:

```
✴ A shipwright builds and repairs starships.
✴ An envoy can arrange introductions or help resolve disputes.
✴ An explorer has delved the depths of the Forge and knows many of
its secrets.
```

**Connections are not shipmates or companions. They are independent Connections are not shipmates or companions. They are independent**

**might accompany the connection on a specific mission, but you’ll soon might accompany the connection on a specific mission, but you’ll soon**

**part ways as your duties and ambitions take you on separate paths.part ways as your duties and ambitions take you on separate paths.**

Here’s a few tips on creating a role for your connection:

```
✴ The connection’s role can be inspired by your character’s background
and recent history. Are they the doctor who found you in a crashed
ship and nursed you back to health? Are they the spymaster who will
task you with missions in this sector?
✴ Consider making the role specific and nuanced. A role such as
xenoarchaeologist is more inspiring than researcher. Spice trader
is more evocative than merchant. This specificity will make their role
less broadly useful for you, but will inspire more interesting stories.
✴ It’s okay if a connection’s role doesn’t provide an obvious benefit for
your character. The narrative purpose of the relationship might be to
introduce situations where you will help them. For example, a farmer
on a backwater world would likely face native wildlife, raiders, natural
disasters, and more. Will you swear iron vows to stand with them?
```

If you want to leave it in the hands of fate, generate a random role using  
the Character Role table on page 331. Elaborate on the answer as  
appropriate to your setting.

Use the  
connections  
worksheet  
to record the  
details of this  
connection.  
Start by  
marking down  
their first role.

### Artifact Smuggler

124 CHAPTER 2: LAUNCHING YOUR CAMPAIGN

#### GIVE THE CONNECTION A RANK

Your connection’s rank represents the challenge of advancing the  
relationship. The higher the rank, the greater the narrative focus and time  
required to eventually Forge a Bond with them.

Choose a rank appropriate to their role and the level of involvement you  
want them to have in your story: troublesome, dangerous, formidable,  
extreme, or epic. For a starting connection, consider making them  
troublesome or dangerous. Mark their rank on the connections worksheet.

Keep in mind that terms such as dangerous don’t describe the nature of this  
person. Rather, they define the potential risks and costs associated with  
the relationship. That said, it’s entirely appropriate to create a connection  
who is also an antagonist. The threads that bind are sometimes frayed.

DEFINE THEIR CHARACTERISTICS

Give the connection a few distinctive  
attributes. You can simply envision what  
you know of this person, or roll on the  
following character oracle tables:

```
✴ First Look (page 330); roll 1–2 times
✴ Character Goal (page 331)
✴ Revealed Character Aspect (page 332); roll 1–2 times
```

Make note of anything interesting in your journal or connections worksheet.

CHOOSE THE CONNECTION’S HOME

Choose a settlement in your sector as the connection’s home. If you’d like  
to get them involved in your story right away, place them at the settlement  
you detailed in step 8. Mark it down on the connections worksheet.

GIVE THE CONNECTION A NAME

Give your connection a name or callsign. If you need inspiration, roll on  
the Character Name oracle on page 333. Make note of this identity on  
the connections worksheet.

NEXT STEPS

Depending on the connection’s role and the whims of narrative events,  
they might serve as a regular patron or associate in your story, or as an  
infrequent acquaintance. As you interact, you can find opportunities to  
Develop Your Relationship and eventually Forge a Bond with them.

Meanwhile, whenever your connection aids you on a move closely  
associated with their role, you may add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.

For now, turn to the next page to wrap up your starting sector.

### Step 10: Introduce a Sector Trouble

You’ve heard rumors of a sector-wide peril, conflict, or mystery. You may  
come up with a trouble appropriate to your setting and character, roll on  
the Action and Theme oracles for inspiration (pages 296 – 297 ), or pick  
or roll on the table below. Envision how this trouble might manifest, and  
make note of it on your sector worksheet or journal.

```
1–5 Blockade prevents trade with other sectors
6–10 Bounty hunters search for an infamous fugitive
11–15 Chaotic breaches in spacetime spread like wildfire
16–20 Criminal faction corrupts local authorities
21–25 Devastating superweapon has fallen into the wrong hands
26–30 Energy storms are rampant
31–35 Magnetic disturbances disrupt communication
36–40 Newly found resource lures greedy fortune hunters to the sector
41–45 Notorious pirate clan preys on starships
46–50 Parasitic lifeforms spread like a plague
51–55 Precursor sites throughout the sector emit strange signals
56–60 Prophecies foretell an imminent awakening of a dreadful power
61–65 Raider clan emerges as a dominant threat under a new leader
66–70 Religious zealots overrun the sector
71–75 Rogue AI infiltrates systems throughout the sector
76–80 Settlements or factions are on the brink of war
81–85 Ships regularly go missing
86–90 Sickness spreads among ships and settlements
91–95 Supernova is imminent
96–100 Titanic spaceborne lifeform stalks the spaceways
```

### Step 11: Finalize the Starting Sector

Give your sector a name. If you’d like a suggestion, roll on the Sector  
Name table on page 302. Write the name on your sector worksheet.

You can also set a controlling power for the sector if a faction came to the  
forefront during the truth’s exercise. If not, keep it ambiguous. Sectors can  
be isolated, chaotic, or home to many insignificant factions. If you want  
to reveal details of a faction during play, use the faction oracles on page  
340 for inspiration.

## BEGIN YOUR ADVENTUREBEGIN YOUR ADVENTURE

In this final exercise, you’ll identify a trouble or goal worthy of an iron vow,  
and set out upon a sworn quest.

```
Allow about 10–20 minutes for this exercise.
```

### What You Need

Have your character sheet, asset cards, and dice ready. To record your  
vow, use your journal or the printable progress track worksheet in the  
Starforged Playkit.

### Step 1: Envision an Inciting Incident

An inciting incident is the problem at the beginning of a story that propels  
the protagonists into action. Everything up to that point is backstory. It is  
the inciting incident that begins your campaign.

At this point, you may already have a problem or mission in mind for the  
start of your campaign. If so, jump to page 131 to get started.

If not, consider the narrative fodder from the previous exercises.

Truths:

```
✴ Selected truths: Which factions, conflicts, or dangers offer an
opportunity for adventure?
✴ Quest starters: Did any of the quest starters associated with your
truths jump out at you as inspiration for your adventures?
```

Character:

```
✴ Paths: Does your character have any duties, skills, or goals that lend
themselves to a quest?
✴ Backstory: Does your backstory imply an immediate danger or goal
that must be dealt with?
✴ Starship: Is your ship in need of anything? Does its history create
trouble for you?
✴ Team: If playing co-op, do you and your allies have any shared or
complementary goals?
```

Sector:

```
✴ Settlements: Are there any settlement aspects, projects, or troubles
that create an opportunity for a quest?
✴ Connection: Based on their role or goal, does your connection need
something from you?
✴ Sector trouble: Does the trouble in this sector, or some aspect of it,
need to be dealt with?
```

128 CHAPTER 2: LAUNCHING YOUR CAMPAIGN

#### WHAT MAKES A GOOD INCITING INCIDENT?

Consider these suggestions for a compelling initial quest:

```
✴ Make it personal: Why is this important to your character? Envision
how this connects to your background, skills, and motivations. Most
tasks are unworthy of a sworn vow. What makes this different?
✴ Make it a problem that won’t go away on its own: The threats or
forces at the heart of this situation will see it through, even if you
ignore them.
✴ Give it a ticking clock: The problem won’t wait for you. If you don’t
act, things will get worse or fall out of reach.
✴ Up the stakes: If the quest seems too mundane, envision factors that
make the inciting incident more interesting or complex.
✴ Limit the scope: Don’t try to save the universe out of the gate.
Envision a trouble or goal that seems manageable—something you
can overcome in a session or two of play.
```

ALLIES AND THE INCITING INCIDENT

If you are playing with others, you will undertake this quest together as  
a shared vow. Discuss your ideas for the incident, and consider how the  
quest fits the nature of your team.

CREATING AN INCITING INCIDENT AS THE GUIDE

If you are the guide, you can introduce an inciting incident based on  
the established setting and character aspects. Or you can moderate the  
creation of an inciting incident with your players to ensure everyone has  
a stake in this quest.

BEGIN YOUR ADVENTURE 129

#### STILL STUCK FOR AN IDEA?

If you need inspiration, do any combination of the following:

```
✴ Roll the Action and Theme oracles (pages 296 – 297 ).
✴ Roll the Character Goal oracle (page 331).
✴ Pick or roll on the table below.
```

```
1–5 Aid a starship caught in a spacetime fracture.
6–10 Broker peace between two feuding settlements
11–15 Chart a new passage between isolated settlements
16–20 Defend the people of a beleaguered settlement against raiders
21–25 Discover who sabotaged a settlement’s air processors
26–30 Escort a tradeship carrying prized cargo
31–35 Ferry a rescue team to a perilous disaster site
36–40 Infiltrate a fortified base to steal crucial data
41–45 Investigate terrifying manifestations at a remote settlement
46–50 Liberate prisoners at a cruel labor camp
51–55 Locate a downed spacer on an uninhabited planet
56–60 Protect a fugitive from a relentless bounty hunter
61–65 Recover a cherished pre-exodus artifact from an enemy
66–70 Rescue a starship crew held captive by mutineers
71–75 Retrieve a cache of stolen weapons from a pirate ship
76–80 Sabotage an enemy installation
81–85 Search for a missing expedition in the depths of a precursor vault
86–90 Shield a wondrous lifeform from those who seek to destroy it
91–95 Track and slay a marauding beast
96–100 Transport a displaced people to their new home
```

Embellish or adjust the result in the context of your established character  
and setting. Be mindful of the best practices on the previous page. Make  
it relevant to your character and worthy of a sworn vow. Make it dramatic  
and interesting. But this will be a lower-ranked quest, so keep it relatively  
straightforward—things may very well spin out of control on their own  
soon enough.

130 CHAPTER 2: LAUNCHING YOUR CAMPAIGN

### Step 2: Set the Scene

Based on the nature of your inciting incident, where will you begin your  
story? Are you in the depths of space, about to encounter some new  
mystery or danger? Are you at the settlement you detailed in the previous  
exercise, ready to take on an urgent sworn mission?

Whatever the location, you have two options for starting play: You can  
begin with a prologue, or in medias res.

STARTING WITH A PROLOGUE

Jumping in with a prologue can help flesh out who you are and how you  
interact with your world. For example, imagine arriving at a settlement.  
Envision your starship settling onto a docking pad. See your character as  
they emerge. Why are you there? Where do you go? How do you interact  
with the inhabitants? Think of this as the sequence in a television show or  
movie before the credits roll. If you have a question about the location or  
the people there, Ask the Oracle.

If you are playing with allies the prologue is an opportunity to roleplay  
your relationships and introduce your personality and backgrounds. Play  
out a scene or two of your mundane day-to-day interactions. This is the  
calm before the storm.

Then, when the time is right, introduce the inciting incident to help drive  
your story forward.

**If you didn’t think of an inciting incident, or aren’t particularly excited If you didn’t think of an inciting incident, or aren’t particularly excited**

**and the current situation. Draw conclusions to those questions or and the current situation. Draw conclusions to those questions or Ask the Ask the**

**OracleOracle. Look for opportunities in the fiction to trigger a vow.. Look for opportunities in the fiction to trigger a vow.**

#### STARTING IN MEDIAS RES

In medias res is a Latin term meaning “in the middle of things.” You start  
your story at a crucial point. Your inciting incident is happening now, or  
is an imminent threat. Raider ships appear on the settlement’s radar. A  
marauding creature attacks. The battered tradeship calls for help.

You can begin with a tense, action-oriented scene as you encounter the  
problem. Or you might frame the scene where you immediately swear a  
vow and commit to this quest, letting the result of that move trigger what  
happens next.

Either way, when it’s time to Swear an Iron Vow, jump to the next page.

BEGIN YOUR ADVENTURE 131

### Step 3: Make the move

To set your quest in motion, as a response to the inciting incident, make  
this move.

### SWEAR AN IRON VOW

```
When you swear upon iron to complete a quest, write your vow and
give it a rank. Then, roll +heart. If you swear this vow to a connection,
add +1; if you share a bond, add +2.
On a strong hit, you are emboldened and it is clear what you must do
next. Take +2 momentum.
On a weak hit, you are determined but begin your quest with more
questions than answers. Take +1 momentum, and envision what you
do to find a path forward.
On a miss, you must overcome a significant obstacle before you
begin your quest. Envision what stands in your way.
```

#### ENVISION THE VOW

First, start with the fiction. This is an important moment for your character  
and your story. You stand at the threshold of new adventures and perils.  
You are about to bind yourself to a sacred promise. What iron totem do  
you hold? What do you say?

SWEARING THE VOW WITH ALLIES

If you are playing with allies, one of you makes the Swear an Iron Vow  
move. Whomever is most connected to this quest, or is at the forefront  
of the incident, should swear the vow. Other players can make the Aid  
Your Ally move as a way of representing their own commitment to this  
quest, but keep in mind that more moves mean more opportunities for  
failure. For the purposes of starting your campaign, it might be best  
to focus on the single move and let others portray their actions in the  
fiction of the scene.

WRITE THE VOW

You and your allies will mark the vow on your vow worksheet or journal.  
Write the name of the vow and give it a rank. Since this is a starting  
vow, hopefully dealt with in a session or two of playtime, give it a rank of  
troublesome or dangerous.

Then, turn to the next page to roll the dice and resolve the move.

132 CHAPTER 2: LAUNCHING YOUR CAMPAIGN

#### ROLLING THE DICE

Grab your action die (one six-sided die) and challenge dice (two ten-sided  
dice) and roll them all at once.

Add the value of your heart stat to the action die. If you are swearing this  
vow to your connection (created in the previous exercise), add +1. If you  
have any assets with a bonus for this move, add those as well. The total of  
your action die, your stat, and any adds is your action score.

Compare the action score to the value of the challenge dice.

```
If your action score beats both challenge dice, you
scored a strong hit. Take +2 momentum. You are confident.
Your next steps are clear. Envision what this means in the
context of the situation, and play to see what happens.
If your action score beats only one of the challenge dice,
you scored a weak hit. Take +1 momentum. You are hesitant
or anxious. Your next steps are unclear. This will typically
lead to new scenes and new moves as you try to gain a
foothold or uncover more about the situation.
If your action score doesn’t beat either challenge die, you
scored a miss. An unexpected danger or obstacle stands
in your way. Envision what it is, or Ask the Oracle. Then,
play to see what happens as you attempt to overcome this
stumbling block.
```

BEGIN YOUR ADVENTURE 133

### Step 4: Next Steps

Depending on the result of the Swear an Iron Vow move, you may have  
a clear path forward, more questions than answers, or may need to  
overcome an immediate obstacle or threat. Envision what the outcome  
means and how you respond.

And then, play. Ask and answer questions about the situations, people,  
creatures, and places you encounter. When you’re unsure, Ask the Oracle.  
When you do something or encounter something within the scope of a  
move, make that move.

At first, you might be a bit confused. You might make mistakes. That’s  
okay. You’ll find your footing soon enough. Keep your reference sheets  
handy. If you have a question about a specific term in a move or asset,  
check out the glossary on page 388. If you have a more involved rules  
question, make a call and move on. You can look up the answer later  
using the details in the next chapter.

For now, you are Ironsworn.

You’ve forged a galaxy.

Make your mark upon it.

## EXPLORING THE DEPTHSEXPLORING THE DEPTHS

In this chapter, we’ll look at Starforged gameplay in more detail. In  
particular, you’ll find expanded information on framing and resolving the  
various moves in the game, along with tips and options for customizing  
your experience.

Don’t read this chapter front-to-back. Instead, if you have a question  
about a specific move, activity, or best-practice, go to that section. Also  
remember that the moves are available as printable handouts in the  
Starforged Playkit. Refer to those handouts during your session, and  
come back to this chapter if you need guidance or want more detail.

### The Three Pillars of Play

Through moves, legacy rewards, and narrative prompts, Starforged  
emphasizes three primary undertakings.

The quest moves (page 154), connection moves (page 162), and  
exploration moves (page 168) directly support these gameplay pillars.  
They are the foundation of your Starforged adventures. Other moves help  
resolve the moment-to-moment perils and opportunities you encounter  
through these activities.

If your story ever feels aimless, without any direction for your character,  
look to these three pillars. Take a quest. Build a relationship. Go explore.  
In fact, you’ll often do all three at once as your quest-bound adventures  
include interactions with key characters and expeditions into the hidden  
depths of the galaxy.

Depending on the nature of your character and the assets you bring to  
bear, you may emphasize one pillar over the others—but none should  
be ignored. They are your touchstones for compelling, emotional, and  
surprising stories.

## SESSION MOVESSESSION MOVES

The session moves fit into the flow of mechanics and fiction before,  
during, and after play. They provide methods for setting up content  
boundaries, adjusting content in the midst of play, and starting and  
ending your Starforged sessions. They are intended for solo, co-op, and  
guided modes.

Unlike most other moves, these session moves function primarily from the  
perspective of the players instead of your characters. They are a tool to  
moderate and facilitate safe and enjoyable play.

campaign setup exercises, see page 78.

140 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### Begin a Session

```
When you begin a significant session or chapter of play, do all of
the following.
✴ Identify or adjust flagged content and Set a Flag.
✴ Review or recap what happened last session.
✴ Set the scene by envisioning your character’s current situation
and intent.
In addition, you may spotlight a new danger, opportunity, or insight.
This can include a scene hidden from your character’s perspective.
If you do, envision a brief vignette (you may roll or choose on the
table below for inspiration). Then, all players take +1 momentum as
you return to play from the viewpoint of your characters.
```

```
1–10 Flashback reveals an aspect of your background or nature
11–20 Flashback reveals an aspect of another character, place,
or faction
21–30Influential character or faction is introduced or given new detail
31–40Seemingly unrelated situations are shown to be connected
41–50External factors create new danger, urgency, or importance
for a quest
51–60Important character is put in danger or suffers a misadventure
61–70Key location is made unsafe or becomes mired in conflict
71–80Unexpected return of an enemy or threat
81–90Peril lies ahead or lurks just out of view
91–100Unforeseen aid is on the way or within reach
```

Make this move as a checkpoint at the start of a session. Take a few  
moments to set or adjust any flagged content, reflect on recent events in  
your story, and frame the current situation.

You may also use the optional prompt to introduce a brief vignette. This  
purely narrative scene can enrich your setting, reveal aspects of your  
character, add details to people and factions, or introduce “off-screen”  
complications and opportunities. If you are playing with others, work  
together to envision the scene, or take turns from one session to the next.

If you are playing solo, you may often play for only a few minutes a  
time, picking up the game and leaving it again as casually as you would  
when reading a novel. If you are playing co-op, you might participate in  
an online game using asynchronous chat. If your game isn’t organized  
into discrete sessions, you should use this move to mark a new chapter.  
The beginning of a new chapter can come after a dramatic cliffhanger,  
or when a meaningful narrative thread has been resolved. Emphasizing  
those transitions will add structure create moments to recap and reflect.

SESSION MOVES 141

### Set a Flag

```
When you identify situations or topics you don’t want to include,
don’t want to envision in detail, or otherwise may need mindfulness
when approaching, that content is now flagged.
When you encounter content flagged as something to approach
mindfully, pause to consider or discuss its role in your story. When you
come across flagged content that you would rather adjust or omit,
Change Your Fate.
```

When you establish content boundaries for everyone at the table or create  
mindfulness for what content is included in your game, make this move.

Set a Flag allows you to define expectations for what content can appear  
in your story. You can flag content that you don’t want to include at all,  
content that you might be okay with including “off-screen,” or content that  
warrants a check-in before it is included.

```
During your campaign launch exercises, one of the players asks to
Set a Flag for harm against children, as they don’t want to include
that in the game in any form. You also Set a Flag for romance,
as you wouldn’t mind including it in the game, but you’d prefer
to check in with everyone else before playing out any romantic
relationships between characters.
```

Whether you have personal comfort levels on what you want to explore in  
a game, or you want to be consistent with the campaign truths, there are  
many reasons why you may want to Set a Flag for certain subject matter,  
events, and actions. By identifying that content you don’t want to include  
in the game, you can dive deeper into all the other possibilities that are  
still on the table.

**While While Set a FlagSet a Flag is usually used when starting a new campaign or when is usually used when starting a new campaign or when**

**you you Begin a SessionBegin a Session, you can also flag content in the middle of a session. , you can also flag content in the middle of a session.**

**Once content has been flagged, it should remain flagged for every Once content has been flagged, it should remain flagged for every**

**session going forward. session going forward.**

142 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### Change Your Fate

```
When you encounter flagged content, reject an oracle, resist a
consequence, or otherwise need to shift your circumstances within
the game for your comfort or enjoyment, pause and identify what
needs to be changed. Choose as many options as appropriate.
✴ Reframe: This didn’t happen the way you first thought. Envision
the moment from another perspective in a way that diminishes or
changes the content.
✴ Refocus: This is not the most important thing happening right
now. Envision how the spotlight shifts to change the focus.
✴ Replace: This happens but with a small adjustment. Switch out an
element and envision how this new detail changes the scenario.
✴ Redirect: Adjust the trajectory to involve a helping hand. Envision
how another person or party becomes involved.
✴ Reshape: The situation changes completely. Envision what
happened instead.
```

When something occurs in your game that you do not want to happen, or  
want to adjust, make this move. It doesn’t matter why or in what situation  
a player may want to change their fate—this move can be triggered at any  
time a player needs it.

```
You come across a wrecked spacecraft and attempt to Resupply.
You roll a miss, and when you Pay the Price you discover the hold is
full of aggressive, spider-like creatures. You realize that spiders are
flagged content, and choose to replace that element by envisioning
a toxic mold spread among the cargo containers.
```

When this move is triggered, the fact that the content needs to be changed  
is not up for argument or negotiation, but how that content is changed  
should be discussed as a group. The player who called for the move takes  
the lead in that discussion.

Multiple options can be used at a time to make change or minimize  
the content as much as is needed. The changes you make can include  
elements of the fiction as well as mechanical outcomes. If this move is  
triggered because of flagged content, consider whether you need to Take  
a Break before or after this move is resolved.

SESSION MOVES 143

### Take a Break

```
When you resolve a progress move or complete an intense scenario,
take a few deep breaths and take some time to attend to the needs of
your body. Reflect on what just happened and how it made you feel.
Then, choose one.
✴ Move on: Continue the session. You or an ally may add +1 on the
next move (not a progress move), bolstered by your reflection
and past experiences.
✴ Stop for now: End a Session.
```

Use this move to introduce a point in the game flow where you pause  
and reflect on the events of the story. When gameplay gets immersive  
or intense, it can be easy to ignore physical cues like hunger, fatigue, or  
muscle stiffness. Also, if the pace is moving quickly, you might not have  
time to process your feelings about what just happened.

This move triggers after you resolve any progress move, hit or miss. This  
can include progress moves for quests, connections, expeditions, and  
combat. Ideally, this triggers at least once for any significant session of  
play. Even if the resolution of this particular challenge is not noteworthy or  
you feel it doesn’t require much reflection, the break is an opportunity to  
get a glass of water, go to the bathroom, or even just check your posture  
before moving on.

The second trigger for this move is intentionally flexible to fit the needs of  
each player, and allow them to define what level of intensity would require  
the need to stop and take a break. This move can and should be triggered  
by anyone who feels they need it.

After you Take a Break, you can choose to continue play or End a Session.  
If you continue play, you may add +1 on whatever move occurs next in  
your game.

```
It has just been revealed that a connection you trusted to guide you
safely through a perilous asteroid field was an enemy spy, leading
you into an ambush where you suffer heavy losses. At the end of
the scene, you Take a Break, stopping to stretch and reflect on how
you feel about the betrayal and the ensuing battle. You decide you
need some time to think about what to do going forward, so you
End a Session for the day.
```

144 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### End a Session

```
When you end a significant session or chapter of play, reflect on
the events of the game and identify any missed opportunities to mark
progress.
✴ If you strengthened your ties to a connection, Develop Your
Relationship.
✴ If you moved forward on a quest, Reach a Milestone.
If there is a quest, connection, or other situation you would like to give
focus in your next session, make note of it and take +1 momentum.
```

Make this move to mark the end of a session. This is an opportunity to  
transition from the fictional space of the game and think or talk about  
the dramatic moments, thrilling successes, agonizing failures, unexpected  
surprises, and what lies ahead in your next session.

You will also consider whether you missed any chances to mark progress  
on a connection or quest during play. Those milestones can sometimes  
pass you by during intense scenes, and this is an ideal moment to recap  
and catalog your successes.

Optionally, you may also make note of anything you’d like to focus on for  
your next session. Consider your character’s goals and the elements of  
the story that interest you. This act of writing it down, putting a stake in  
the ground, is a reminder and encouragement to pick up that thread when  
you next Begin a Session. If you are playing with others, be respectful of  
sharing the spotlight and work together to affirm the aspects of the story  
and setting you want to explore in more detail, or take turns suggesting a  
focus from one session to the next. If you are playing as the guide, use this  
input from the players to help kick off the next session.

**As noted in the As noted in the Begin a SessionBegin a Session move, the start and end of your sessions move, the start and end of your sessions**

## ADVENTURE MOVESADVENTURE MOVES

The adventure moves encompass broadly useful actions to overcome  
obstacles, reinforce your position, conduct investigations, influence  
others, and support your fellow protagonists. When you face a peril or try  
to gain leverage, and another move does not apply, you’ll likely find your  
answer among these moves.

146 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### Face Danger

```
When you attempt something risky or react to an imminent threat,
envision your action and roll. If you act...
✴ With speed, mobility, or agility: Roll +edge
✴ With resolve, command, or sociability: Roll +heart
✴ With strength, endurance, or aggression: Roll +iron
✴ With deception, stealth, or trickery: Roll +shadow
✴ With expertise, focus, or observation: Roll +wits
On a strong hit, you are successful. Take +1 momentum.
On a weak hit, you succeed, but not without a cost.
Make a suffer move (-1).
On a miss, you fail, or a momentary success is undermined by a dire
turn of events. Pay the Price.
```

This move is a catch-all for risky, dramatic, or complex actions not covered  
by another move. If you’re trying to overcome an obstacle or resist a  
threat, and another move doesn’t seem to apply, Face Danger to see what  
happens. Envision your approach, select the stat that best reflects how  
you deal with the obstacle, and make the action roll.

```
While riding your HOVERBIKE across a snowbound world, you find
yourself in the path of an avalanche. You decide to try to outrun the
deluge at top speed, and Face Danger +edge.
```

A strong hit means you succeed. You are in control. What do you do next?

A weak hit means you overcome the obstacle or avoid the threat, but  
not without cost. Choose a fitting suffer move (page 198), and face a  
minor (-1) cost. If appropriate to the situation, an ally can suffer the cost by  
making that move.

A miss means you are thwarted in your action, fail to oppose the threat,  
or are successful but at great cost. You must Pay the Price. You might  
suffer an immediate narrative and mechanical cost—such as your vehicle  
taking a hit as you Withstand Damage. Or the miss might simply introduce  
an escalating danger or new complication. Either way, the miss should  
trigger a result that is more dramatic or harrowing than the cost you pay  
on a weak hit.

If you are in the midst of a fight, do not make this move. React Under  
Fire is a variation of this move used for combat scenes. If you’re in a fight  
overcoming an obstacle or avoiding an immediate danger—whether in a  
vehicle or on foot—make that move instead of this one.

ADVENTURE MOVES 147

### Secure an Advantage

```
When you assess a situation, make preparations, or attempt to
gain leverage, envision your action and roll. If you act...
✴ With speed, mobility, or agility: Roll +edge
✴ With resolve, command, or sociability: Roll +heart
✴ With strength, endurance, or aggression: Roll +iron
✴ With deception, stealth, or trickery: Roll +shadow
✴ With expertise, focus, or observation: Roll +wits
On a hit, you succeed. On a strong hit, take both. On a weak hit,
choose one.
✴ Take +2 momentum
✴ Add +1 on your next move (not a progress move)
On a miss, you fail or your assumptions betray you. Pay the Price.
```

Triggering and resolving Secure an Advantage is similar to Face Danger.  
You envision your action and roll + your most relevant stat. This move,  
however, is proactive rather than reactive. Instead of responding to an  
immediate obstacle or threat, you’re operating from a position of strength  
and attempting to bolster that position.

This move will often encompass a moment in time—such as trying to read  
your opponent in a not-so-friendly game of cards. Or it can represent  
preparation spanning minutes, hours, or even days.

```
You hope to secure the aid of a mercenary guild in a war against a
powerful horde of raiders, and have gained an audience with the
guild’s leader. In an attempt to start the meeting on good terms,
you Secure an Advantage by praising their exploits in battle. You
roll +heart to learn the impact of your flattery.
```

A hit means you’ve identified an opportunity or gained the upper hand.  
You moved into position to covertly study the enemy base. You prepared a  
clever disguise. You assembled an experimental engine-boosting device.  
You scouted the best path through the asteroid field. Now it’s time to build  
on your success.

A miss means your attempt to gain advantage has backfired. You acted  
too slowly, presumed too much, were outwitted or outmatched, or were  
confounded by unlucky chance. You must Pay the Price.

If you are in the midst of a fight, do not make this move. Instead, you  
should Gain Ground when attempting to reinforce your position during  
combat scenes.

148 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### Gather Information

```
When you search for clues, conduct an investigation, analyze
evidence, or do research, roll +wits.
On a strong hit, you discover something helpful and specific. The
path you must follow or action you must take to make progress is
made clear. Envision what you learn. Then, take +2 momentum.
On a weak hit, the information provides new insight, but also
complicates your quest. Envision what you discover. Then, take +1
momentum.
On a miss, you unearth a dire threat or reveal an unwelcome truth
that undermines your quest. Pay the Price.
```

Use this move when you make a careful search or do fact-finding. What  
you uncover may reveal the best path forward, or introduce new twists  
and turns in your quest.

How does this differ from other moves using insight or observation?  
When you’re forced to react with awareness or knowledge to deal with  
an immediate threat or complicated activity, that’s Face Danger. When  
you size up your options or use expertise to bolster your position, that’s  
Secure an Advantage. If you’re in a fight, use Gain Ground and React  
Under Fire to devise clever strategies or overcome dangers. If you learn  
the nature of something without taking direct action, Ask the Oracle. But if  
you’re spending time searching, investigating, analyzing, interrogating—  
especially related to a quest—that’s when you Gather Information. Think  
of it this way: Gather Information is focused on story, tending to introduce  
new complications. Those other moves are focused on situations. Use  
the move most appropriate to the circumstances and your intent.

```
You are sworn to capture an infamous fugitive who is rumored to
be hiding out at an outpost. You envision making discreet inquiries
among the locals, and Gather Information to see what you learn.
```

A strong hit means you gain valuable new information. You know what you  
need to do next. Envision what you learn, or Ask the Oracle.

With a weak hit, you’ve learned something important, but it makes your  
quest more complicated or dangerous. Your character’s position is  
improved through the discovery of this information, but it’s unwelcome  
news all the same.

On a miss, a harrowing new threat is revealed, or you learn of something  
that contradicts previous information or severely complicates your quest.  
This is a dreadful turn, and you must Pay the Price.

ADVENTURE MOVES 149

### Compel

```
When you try to persuade someone or make them an offer, envision
your approach. If you...
✴ Charm, pacify, encourage, or barter: Roll +heart
✴ Threaten or incite: Roll +iron
✴ Lie or swindle: Roll +shadow
On a strong hit, they’ll do what you want or agree to your conditions.
Take +1 momentum.
On a weak hit, as above, but their agreement comes with a demand
or complication. Envision their counteroffer.
On a miss, they refuse or make a demand that costs you greatly. Pay
the Price.
```

When you act to persuade someone to do as you ask, or to give you  
something of value, make this move. It might be through bargaining,  
charm, diplomacy, intimidation, or trickery. Use the appropriate stat based  
on your approach and roll to see what happens.

```
You are attempting to obtain a desperately needed part for your
ship from a stingy equipment dealer. You know of their fondness
for pre-cataclysm art; luckily you have a piece to offer in trade. But
this relic is a fake. Do they fall for the con and agree to the deal?
You roll +shadow to find out.
```

On a strong hit, they agree. Move forward with their cooperation.

On a weak hit, they offer a counter-proposal or introduce a complicating  
factor. Look to the fiction to understand their response. What would they  
want? What would satisfy their concerns or motivate them to comply? If  
you’re not sure, Ask the Oracle. Then, if you accept their offer, you gain  
their (perhaps grudging) support. If not, you need to find another path.

On a miss, they are insulted, angered, inflexible, see through your lies, or  
demand something with a dire cost. Their response should introduce new  
dangers or complications.

If you promise something as part of the Compel move, but then fail to do  
as you promised, others should respond accordingly. Perhaps it means  
a rude welcome when next you return to this community. If they are  
powerful, they may even act against you. If they are a connection, you  
would probably Test Your Relationship. Your actions, good or bad, should  
have ramifications for your story beyond the scope of the move.

150 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

Making the Compel move doesn’t give you free rein to control the actions  
of other characters in your world. Remember: fiction first. Consider their  
motivations. What is your leverage over them? What do they stand to gain  
or avoid? Do you have an existing relationship? If your argument has no  
merit, or your threat or promise carries no weight, you can’t make this  
move. You can’t intimidate your way out of a situation where you are at  
a clear disadvantage. You can’t barter when you offer nothing of value. If  
you are unsure, Ask the Oracle, “Would they consider this?” If the answer  
is yes, make the move.

On the other hand, if their positive response is all but guaranteed—you are  
acting obviously in their best interest or offering a trade of good value—  
don’t make the move. Just make it happen. Save the move for times when  
the situation is uncertain and dramatic.

ADVENTURE MOVES 151

### Aid Your Ally

```
When you act in direct support of an ally, envision how you aid
them. Then, Secure an Advantage or Gain Ground to take action. If
you score a hit, they (instead of you) take the benefits of the move.
If you Gain Ground and score a strong hit, you are both in control. On
a weak hit, your ally is in control but you are in a bad spot.
```

Make this move when you are helping an ally (a protagonist played by  
another player) by taking a supporting action. You might be distracting a  
foe in combat, using the ship’s scanners to scout the path for your pilot  
on an expedition, or giving an ally encouragement as you stand against a  
dire threat.

Outside of a fight, your effort is resolved using the Secure an Advantage,  
move. If you are in combat, use Gain Ground. If you score a hit, your ally  
takes the mechanical and narrative benefit of your success.

```
Your ship must find a way through a dense asteroid field. “Can
you plot a path for me?” the pilot asks. This is an opportunity
for you to Aid Your Ally. You envision using the ship’s scanners
to find the safest course through the chaos, and roll Secure an
Advantage +wits. If successful, you will pass along the benefits of
the outcome to the pilot.
```

In combat, this is a proactive move, made when you are in control.  
If you score a strong hit, you and your ally are both in control. On a weak  
hit, your ally is in control, but you sacrifice your position for their benefit  
and are put in a bad spot.

If you Aid an Ally and have an asset that gives you any additional benefits  
on the outcome of your Secure an Advantage or Gain Ground move, your  
ally also takes those benefits (instead of you).

If you score a miss as you Aid Your Ally, one or both of you should Pay the  
Price as appropriate to the circumstances and your intent when making  
the move. If you are in a fight, both of you are now in a bad spot.

Don’t ping pong this move back and forth between two characters in an  
attempt to build momentum. Envision what you are doing to Aid Your Ally,  
make the move, resolve it, and hand the reins over to your ally as they  
leverage the advantage. Keep it moving. Make things happen.

152 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### Check Your Gear

```
When you check to see if you have a specific helpful item or
resource, roll +supply.
On a strong hit, you have it, and are ready to act. Take +1 momentum.
On a weak hit, you have it, but must choose one.
✴ Your supply is diminished: Sacrifice Resources (-1)
✴ It’s not quite right, and causes a complication or delay: Lose
Momentum (-2)
On a miss, you don’t have it and the situation grows more perilous.
Pay the Price.
```

In Starforged, you don’t track a detailed inventory of items and resources.  
Instead, you are equipped as appropriate to the situation and your vision  
for your character. This may lead to circumstances where you aren’t sure  
if you are prepared for an unexpected challenge. When you check to see  
if you have a particular item or resource on-hand, make this move.

On a strong hit, you’ve got it. Envision your character leveraging this item  
or resource. Plus, take a +1 momentum bonus to represent your readiness.

```
You are bitten by a snake-like creature on a jungle world, and suffer
an intense reaction from its venom. Do you have an appropriate
antitoxin in your medkit? You Check Your Gear to find out, and
roll a strong hit. You take the momentum bonus, and are now in a
position to Heal using the antitoxin to recover your lost health.
```

On a weak hit, you have it, but your supply is reduced or you must make  
do with something that’s not a perfect fit for the situation. Choose your  
cost and make the appropriate suffer move.

On a miss, you don’t have what you need, and things get worse. You must  
Pay the Price. This may mean turning the peril of the current situation up  
a notch or inflicting an immediate negative outcome.

ADVENTURE MOVES 153

## QUEST MOVES

In the fiction of the Starforged setting, those who swear vows are the  
Ironsworn, and their promises are binding. Vows can be made to yourself,  
as a solemn representation of your personal commitment, or as a promise  
to someone else. Some vows might be made grudgingly—out of duty,  
necessity, or tradition. Others will be made with your whole heart.

Make these quest moves when you swear vows, make progress on your  
quests, and resolve vows.

```
Swear an Iron Vow (page 156)
When you swear upon iron to complete a quest...
```

```
Reach a Milestone (page 157)
When you make headway in your quest...
```

```
Fulfill Your Vow (page 158)
When you reach the end of your quest...
```

```
Forsake Your Vow (page 160)
When you renounce your quest, betray your promise, or the goal is
lost to you...
```

These sworn quests are the narrative engine of your adventures. In pursuit  
of your vows, you will undertake perilous expeditions, uncover clues, gain  
the support of others, recover important items, and defeat powerful foes.  
Your character will struggle to overcome their own limitations and find  
their preconceptions and loyalties challenged.

Overcoming obstacles isn’t just for dramatic purposes. Succeeding against  
trials, finding your way forward, enables you to Reach a Milestone and  
mark progress on quests. When you Fulfill Your Vow, you gain experience  
through your quests legacy track that may be spent to improve your  
character and their resources.

But not every task or goal is a vow. If a situation is not dramatic or relevant  
to your character’s goals and principles, it’s probably not worthy of a sworn  
quest. It might be a milestone for another quest, or simply a narrative  
diversion as an opportunity for roleplaying or worldbuilding.

To learn more about managing quests, see page 161.

QUESTQUEST MOVES MOVES 155155

### Swear an Iron Vow

```
When you swear upon iron to complete a quest, write your vow and
give it a rank. Then, roll +heart. If you swear this vow to a connection,
add +1; if you share a bond, add +2.
On a strong hit, you are emboldened and it is clear what you must do
next. Take +2 momentum.
On a weak hit, you are determined but begin your quest with more
questions than answers. Take +1 momentum, and envision what you
do to find a path forward.
On a miss, you must overcome a significant obstacle before you
begin your quest. Envision what stands in your way.
```

When you give your word to serve someone, resolve to undo a wrong, or  
undertake a personal ambition, make this move.

First, give the vow a name and set the rank of your quest: troublesome,  
dangerous, formidable, extreme, or epic. Higher ranked vows require  
more effort and more focus in your story, but offer greater legacy rewards.  
An epic quest could be the endeavor of a lifetime, while a troublesome  
quest might be resolved in a few scenes.

Then, envision how your character enacts the vow. Is this a moment of  
grudging acceptance or one of fiery determination?

```
An agricultural settlement is preyed upon by raiders, and you Swear
an Iron Vow to help them fight back. You hold the iron and speak
the vow in the central square, witnessed by the hopeful farmers.
```

On a strong hit, your path is clear, and you may envision how you begin the  
quest. If you score a weak hit, the way forward is uncertain or complicated;  
investigation may be required to identify your next steps.

On a miss, you face a serious obstacle at the very start. It might be an  
unexpected event, someone working against you, or a personal conviction  
holding you back. If unsure, Ask the Oracle. Your quest cannot properly  
begin until you deal with this complication, which means you do not Reach  
a Milestone and mark progress when overcoming it.

When allies join together to Swear an Iron Vow, this is a shared quest. One  
of you speaks for the group and makes the move. If you score a hit and  
take +momentum, only the character making the move takes that bonus.  
Others benefit narratively from your success or face the consequences  
of your failure. Once the quest is underway, you share a single progress  
track and mark progress together as you Reach a Milestone.

156 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### Reach a Milestone

```
When you make headway in your quest by doing any of the
following...
✴ overcoming a critical obstacle
✴ gaining meaningful insight
✴ completing a perilous expedition
✴ acquiring a crucial item or resource
✴ earning vital support
✴ defeating a notable foe
...you may mark progress per the rank of the vow.
```

When you Swear an Iron Vow, the quest is given a challenge rank and  
managed through a progress track (page 39). Then, as you strive to  
complete your quest, you face and overcome challenges. Some of these  
challenges arise naturally out of the fiction of your situation. Others  
represent narrative twists introduced when you interpret the result of a  
move or when you Ask the Oracle for inspiration. When you reach these  
turning points and forge ahead in your vow, make this move and mark  
progress on the related quest.

```
You need to properly arm the farmers to fight the marauding
raiders, so you reach out to a black market connection and call in
a favor. Once the weapons are secured, you Reach a Milestone.
```

The move includes a list of milestone triggers, but there is flexibility in  
how you interpret accomplishments and events in your story. The pace  
of your quests is largely defined by what you set as milestones. They  
should be meaningful to your character and your vow, requiring effort and  
sacrifice. An insignificant discovery or effortless success is probably not  
a milestone.

If you’re not sure if something is worthy of a milestone, trust your instincts  
and the type of play experience you want to create. If you’re playing co-op  
or guided, talk it out at the table. If you are in doubt, err on the side of  
success; Reach a Milestone and play to see what happens next.

If you find your story moving to a resolution well ahead of your progress  
track, envision some complications or twists that alter your path and  
create new opportunities for milestones. But remember it’s not necessary  
to fill the quest progress track before you Fulfill Your Vow. Use the Reach a  
Milestone move as a pacing mechanism to move things toward an exciting  
conclusion with a good chance of success, but don’t fight the story when  
it feels inevitable. Let the chips fall where they may.

QUEST MOVES 157

### Fulfill Your Vow

```
Progress Move
When you reach the end of your quest, roll the challenge dice and
compare to your progress.
On a strong hit, your vow is fulfilled. Mark a reward on your quests
legacy track per the vow’s rank: troublesome=1 tick; dangerous=2
ticks; formidable=1 box; extreme=2 boxes; epic=3 boxes. Any allies
who shared this vow also mark the reward.
On a weak hit, as above, but there is more to be done or you realize
the truth of your quest. If you Swear an Iron Vow to set things right,
take your full legacy reward. Otherwise, make the legacy reward one
rank lower (none for a troublesome quest).
On a miss, your vow is undone through an unexpected complication
or realization. Envision what happens and choose one.
✴ Give up on the quest: Forsake Your Vow.
✴ Recommit to the quest: Roll both challenge dice, take the lowest
value, and clear that number of progress boxes. Then, raise the
vow’s rank by one (if not already epic).
```

The fiction driving your vow and the mechanical incentive represented  
by your progress track converge in the decisive moment when you  
believe your quest is at an end. Are you truly victorious? Make this move  
to find out.

Since this is a progress move (page 42), tally the number of filled  
boxes on your quest progress track. This is your progress score. Only  
add fully filled boxes (those with four ticks). Then, roll your challenge dice,  
compare to the progress score, and resolve a strong hit, weak hit, or miss  
as normal. You may not burn momentum, and you are not affected by  
negative momentum.

Are you working with allies to fulfill a shared vow? If so, one of you  
represents the group and makes the progress roll.

Managing your mechanical progress and the fiction to reach this moment  
may require a bit of stagecraft. It’s the end of the third act. Your actors  
must be in position. Your sets and props need to be in place. The lights  
come up for the final scene...

However, keep in mind it’s not necessary to fill your vow’s progress track  
before you Fulfill Your Vow. Has the fiction led you to a moment when your  
quest seems complete, but the progress track is not even half full? Go with  
it. A weak hit or miss on the Fulfill Your Vow move can create interesting  
stories and motivate new vows.

158 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

If you roll a strong hit as you Fulfill Your Vow, this is a decisive and  
successful end for the quest. Mark the legacy reward on your quests  
legacy track and envision the impact of this moment. Then, decide what  
you do next. Are there other quests to attend to? Will you set off to find  
new opportunities? Or does this victory allow you to finally leave your life  
as Ironsworn behind?

On a weak hit, you discover or realize something that subverts your  
success. Envision what you learn or Ask the Oracle. Think of this as obeying  
the letter, but not the spirit, of your vow. Did you defeat your sworn enemy  
in a fierce battle, but with their dying breath they reveal someone else was  
pulling their strings? Did you help a patron reach a lost settlement, only  
to learn of their nefarious plans for that place? Did you capture a fugitive,  
but discover they are innocent of any crimes? Decide if you take up a new  
quest to deal with the problem you discovered or unwittingly unleashed.  
If not, be done with it and mark the reward one rank lower.

```
After leading the people of the settlement in a fierce fight against
the raiders, you’ve run off the last of them. Is this the end of your
quest? You make a progress roll to find out. Unfortunately, you roll
a weak hit. What does this mean? You envision the aftermath of the
fight. Lives were lost, buildings burned, equipment destroyed. This
was a pyrrhic victory, and now the settlers are ill-equipped to bring
in their harvest and face the other ravages of this perilous planet.
Will you leave them to fend for themselves, or swear a new vow to
see them fully recovered?
```

On a miss, a turn of events finds you defeated, or your goal is suddenly  
beyond reach. The ancient relic is found, but it is a forgery. You’ve  
hunted and defeated a marauding forgespawn, but discover it was only  
one of a horde of corrupted beasts. The snub fighter attack on your  
guild’s command ship was merely a diversion, and a boarding party has  
managed to sneak on board and take over the bridge. If you choose to  
press on, the nature of your quest remains the same—find the relic, stop  
the ravages of the forgespawn, protect the command ship—but some of  
your progress is undone and the quest is made more difficult through this  
dramatic realization.

QUEST MOVES 159

### Forsake Your Vow

```
When you renounce your quest, betray your promise, or the goal is
lost to you, clear the vow.
Then, envision the impact of this failure and choose one or more as
appropriate to the nature of the vow. Any allies who shared this vow
may also envision a cost.
✴ You are demoralized or dispirited: Endure Stress
✴ A connection loses faith: Test Your Relationship when you
next interact.
✴ You must abandon a path or resource: Discard an asset.
✴ Someone else pays a price: Envision how a person, being, or
community bears the cost of the failure.
✴ Someone else takes advantage: Envision how an enemy
gains power.
✴ Your reputation suffers: Envision how this failure marks you.
```

Make this move when you willfully abandon a quest, or if circumstances  
leave your goal unobtainable.

Realizing you must Forsake Your Vow is a dramatic and disheartening  
decision. Consider how your failure affects your story and what you do to  
put yourself back on the proper path. Did you swear this vow in service to  
others? How does this impact your relationship with them? If your vow was  
a personal quest, how does this force you to rethink the path your life has  
taken? Where do you go from here?

```
You were sworn to recover a valuable cache of stolen supplies,
but your quest has fallen out of reach. The thief’s starship was
surprisingly fragile, and the supplies were reduced to atoms in the
ensuing explosion. Now, you’ll need to report the bad news to your
benefactor, the powerful head of a trade guild.
```

The move includes several prompts to consider for the ramifications  
of your vow and the narrative and mechanical costs. Choose the most  
appropriate (or more than one) and weave that outcome into your story.  
Depending on the situation, there may be long-term or delayed effects; if  
so, make note of them.

If you abandon a quest that is central to your character’s motivations, you  
may decide your life as Ironsworn is done. If so, Continue a Legacy to see  
what you leave for those who follow in your footsteps.

160 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### Managing Multiple Quests

It is not necessary to resolve one vow before swearing another. In fact,  
your character will run afoul of situations and get sidetracked with new  
vows while they have an ongoing quest. This is the life of the Ironsworn.

Except on rare occasions, you should not Reach a Milestone on multiple  
vows at once. But you might have a quest that serves as a subquest for  
another. For example, someone might ask you to Swear an Iron Vow to  
aid them before they agree to help on your own quest. In order to move  
forward in the main quest, you must Fulfill Your Vow on that new quest.  
Once that is done, you can Reach a Milestone on the original vow.

When is an obstacle its own subquest instead of just a milestone?  
Look to the fiction. Is it a significant, self-contained challenge? Does it  
create opportunities for new drama and conflict? Is it meaningful to your  
character or to another character who is tasking you with this quest? If so,  
it’s probably worthy of a vow.

You will also encounter opportunities for new quests that have no bearing  
on a current vow. This may happen organically through the fiction, via  
oracle prompts, or as introduced by your guide in guided play. For  
example, if you Sojourn and score a miss, you have the option to introduce  
a trouble in the community and can Swear an Iron Vow to aid them.

If you ever find yourself without a quest to pursue, you can enjoy this  
temporary respite from your sworn obligations. Go explore. Visit a  
connection. Take on a mundane job that fits your character’s role. You’ll  
encounter a worthwhile trouble soon enough. If you’re impatient, look to  
your setting truths and your character’s goals. Kick an ant’s nest. Make  
something happen.

### Creating a Quest Outline

If you find it helpful, you can  
envision and write down the  
potential narrative steps in the  
quest. Your outline should provide  
ideas for key challenges, with each  
step an opportunity to Reach a  
Milestone.

However, you should consider it a  
sketchy, unreliable plan. It is like an  
ancient map with “here there be  
monsters” written in blank spaces.  
Leave yourself open to surprises,  
new ideas, input from other  
players, and the whims of fate.

```
Protect Redhaven from the Raiders
1) Find weapons for the farmers
2) Teach the farmers to fight
3) Prepare fortifications
4) Spy on the raiders to learn
their plans
5) Repel the raider attack
6) Defeat the raider leader
Profit???
```

QUEST MOVES 161

## CONNECTION MOVESCONNECTION MOVES

Connections are NPCs (non-player characters) who represent a deep,  
vital, or interesting relationship in your story. They are your tethers to the  
people and places of the Forge.

Make these connection moves when you introduce connections and as  
you build influence or understanding with them.

```
Make a Connection (page 163)
When you search out a new relationship or give focus to an existing
relationship (not an ally or companion)...
```

```
Develop Your Relationship (page 164)
When you reinforce your relationship with a connection...
```

```
Test Your Relationship (page 165)
When your relationship with a connection is tested through conflict,
betrayal, or circumstance...
```

```
Forge a Bond (page 166)
When your relationship with a connection is ready to evolve...
```

Connections are not your allies (protagonists portrayed by other players),  
nor are they companions (robots, creatures, or people who accompany  
you on your adventures, represented by companion assets). Instead,  
connections are characters who are independent of you, but whose lives  
occasionally intersect with your own. You begin your campaign with one  
established connection (page 123). Others are developed through the  
course of your adventures. Some examples of connections include:

```
✴ A faction representative who tasks you with missions
✴ A ship mechanic at a remote facility you rely on for crucial repairs
✴ A fence who helps you unload or acquire goods of dubious origin
✴ An old friend who provides advice or comfort
```

Connections provide story hooks for quests and support you within the  
scope of their role. They usually represent positive relationships, but not  
always; a connection might instead be a rival or someone who wields  
power over you.

If you are playing with allies, a connection can be shared—in which case  
you track progress on that connection together. Over time, you’ll likely  
have a mix of shared and individual connections representing the diverse  
nature of your group.

162 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### Make a Connection

```
When you search out a new relationship or give focus to an existing
relationship (not an ally or companion), roll +heart.
On a strong hit, you create a connection. Give them a role and rank.
Whenever your connection aids you on a move closely associated
with their role, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.
On a weak hit, as above, but this connection comes with a complication
or cost. Envision what they reveal or demand.
On a miss, you don’t make a connection and the situation worsens.
Pay the Price.
```

If you’ve established a meaningful relationship with an NPC and want to  
give that person an ongoing presence in your story, make this move. You  
can also Make a Connection with an entirely new NPC by searching them  
out when you’re in need of someone who fits a specific role or capability.

```
You arrive at a planetside settlement in desperate need of
provisioning. You want to find a merchant who can provide ongoing
support at this outpost, and envision exploring the local market.
You roll +heart to see if you encounter any candidates.
```

On a hit, you establish the connection. Give them a role to represent their  
duty, expertise, or background (see page 124 for details on connection  
roles). Then, set the connection’s rank appropriate to their stature in the  
setting and the level of involvement you want them to have in your story:  
troublesome, dangerous, formidable, extreme, or epic. The higher their  
rank, the greater the narrative focus and time required to eventually Forge  
a Bond with them, and the greater the legacy rewards when you do so.  
Finally, make note of their name, location, and any other characteristics  
worth recording. You can use character oracle tables (page 330) to flesh  
out their look and nature.

On a weak hit, the connection also introduces an immediate problem. They  
might demand something of you or reveal an aspect of their background  
or other commitments that complicates your relationship.

On a miss, circumstances or your assumptions turn entirely against you.  
You fail to make the connection and things get worse.

Once you successfully Make a Connection, you may thereafter add +1 and  
take +1 momentum on a hit if they support you as you make a move. As  
you interact, you can find opportunities to Develop Your Relationship and  
eventually Forge a Bond with them.

CONNECTION MOVES 163

### Develop Your Relationship

```
When you reinforce your relationship with a connection by doing
any of the following...
✴ swearing a vow to undertake a perilous quest in their service
✴ completing a quest to their benefit
✴ leveraging their help in desperate circumstances
✴ giving them something of worth
✴ sharing a profound moment
✴ standing with them against hardship
✴ overcoming a test of your relationship
...you may mark progress per the rank of the connection.
If you already share a bond with the connection, do not mark
progress. Instead, roll +their rank to learn the impact on your
legacy: troublesome=+1; dangerous=+2; formidable=+3; extreme=+4;
epic=+5. On a strong hit, mark 2 ticks on your bonds legacy track.
On a strong hit with a match, you may also envision how recent
events bolstered your connection’s standing and raise their rank by
one (if not already epic). On a weak hit, take +2 momentum. On a
miss, take no lasting benefit.
```

When you build influence with a connection through a significant  
interaction, event, or deed, make this move.

There are several triggers to help define the bounds of what it means to  
evolve your relationship. But the pace is largely under your control. It’s  
a big galaxy, so any meaningful interaction with a connection is likely an  
opportunity to Develop Your Relationship.

```
You deliver a precursor artifact to one of your connections, a
researcher studying alien technology. This unique gift enables you
to Develop Your Relationship.
```

Unbonded connections are managed through progress tracks (page  
39 ). When you make this move, mark progress on the connection’s  
progress track per their rank. Eventually, you can Forge a Bond and make  
a progress roll against this progress track.

If you already share a bond with a connection, you no longer have a  
progress track associated with them. Instead of marking progress, make  
an action roll using the connection’s rank. A success on this roll offers  
immediate benefits, including legacy rewards on a strong hit. This is your  
incentive to nurture a relationship even after you Forge a Bond.

164 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### Test Your Relationship

```
When your relationship with a connection is tested through
conflict, betrayal, or circumstance, roll +heart. If you share a bond,
add +1.
On a strong hit, Develop Your Relationship.
On a weak hit, Develop Your Relationship, but also envision a demand
or complication as a fallout of this test.
On a miss, or if you have no interest in maintaining this relationship,
choose one.
✴ Lose the connection: Envision how this impacts you and Pay
the Price.
✴ Prove your loyalty: Envision what you offer or what they demand,
and Swear an Iron Vow (formidable or greater) to see it done.
Until you complete the quest, take no benefit for the connection.
If you refuse or fail, the connection is permanently undone.
```

The paths you pursue or events in your story may force a reckoning for  
your relationships. How strong is the commitment? If you try to maintain  
this connection, at what cost? When you act against a connection, face a  
significant disagreement or misunderstanding, or refuse or fail a crucial  
assignment, make this move to see what becomes of the relationship.

```
After learning the true identity of your target, you renounce a
bounty contract. Now, you must face your patron, the head of a
powerful hunter’s guild. You envision how you make your case,
then Test Your Relationship to learn their response.
```

On a strong hit—in spite of everything—this test strengthens your  
relationship. Envision how you emerge from the trial with a renewed pact,  
respect, or rapport.

With a weak hit, the relationship evolves, but you must deal with an  
ongoing complication or concession. Things may remain fraught or tense.

On a miss, the relationship is at a tipping point. Retaining the connection  
will require a quest to affirm your loyalty; you cannot use the mechanical  
or narrative benefits of the connection until the quest is done. If you don’t  
take up the quest, the connection is broken.

If an incident forces this test, but you aren’t in a position to resolve it, make  
a note. Then, make this move when you next come in contact. If extended  
time passes without making the test, it may be appropriate to simply clear  
the connection and be done with it.

CONNECTION MOVES 165

### Forge a Bond

```
Progress Move
When your relationship with a connection is ready to evolve, roll
the challenge dice and compare to your progress.
On a strong hit, you now share a bond. Mark a reward on your
bonds legacy track per the connection’s rank: troublesome=1 tick;
dangerous=2 ticks; formidable=1 box; extreme=2 boxes; epic=3 boxes.
Any allies who share this connection also mark the reward. Then,
choose one.
✴ Bolster their influence: When they aid you on a move closely
associated with their role, add +2 instead of +1.
✴ Expand their influence: Give them a second role. When they aid
you on a move closely associated with either role, add +1 and
take +1 momentum on a hit.
On a weak hit, as above, but they ask something more of you first.
To gain the bond and the legacy reward, envision the nature of the
request, and do it (or Swear an Iron Vow to see it done).
On a miss, they reveal a motivation or background that puts you at
odds. If you recommit to this relationship, roll both challenge dice,
take the lowest value, and clear that number of progress boxes. Then,
raise the connection’s rank by one (if not already epic).
```

A bond represents a deeper, more meaningful relationship with a  
connection. Building a bond reinforces your commitment, bolsters the  
connection’s aid, and provides experience through legacy rewards. When  
you have accrued progress on a connection’s progress track and are  
ready to take the relationship to the next level, make this move.

Since this is a progress move (page 42), tally the number of filled  
boxes on your progress track for the connection. This is your progress  
score. Only add fully filled boxes (those with four ticks). Then, roll your  
challenge dice, compare to the progress score, and resolve a strong hit,  
weak hit, or miss as normal. You may not burn momentum, and you are not  
affected by negative momentum.

If this is a mutual connection with allies, you share a progress track. When  
it is time to Forge a Bond, one of you makes the move for the group. Each  
of you marks the legacy reward for your character.

In the fiction of your story, forging a bond can be ceremonial. Perhaps  
you exchange gifts or share a promise. If so, envision what you do or say.  
This will add color and texture to the setting, and give the moment proper  
weight. Otherwise, the bond is a new phase that you (the player) are  
aware of, but is not formally recognized by the characters.

166 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

When you Forge a Bond and score a strong hit, you now share a bond.  
Mark progress on your bonds legacy track per the rank of the connection.  
Then, choose whether they are made more helpful under their existing  
role, or if they gain a new role.

Beyond the mechanical support of the bond, consider how the evolution of  
the relationship impacts your future interactions. What new responsibilities  
or opportunities does it introduce?

On a weak hit, they ask more of you. It might be a task, an item, a  
concession, or even a vow. Envision what they need or Ask the Oracle for  
insight. If you agree, gain the bond. If you refuse or fail to complete the  
request, the connection is not necessarily lost (although you may need  
to Test Your Relationship), but you cannot attempt to Forge a Bond again  
unless those circumstances change.

On a miss, things are not as they seemed. The connection reveals  
something that fundamentally undermines or alters your relationship.  
Have they kept important information from you? Do they have an ulterior  
motive? Do you discover their ties to an enemy or rival? If you choose to  
maintain the relationship, you face a setback and must rebuild on these  
new terms. If there is no coming back after this revelation, simply clear the  
connection and envision how you move forward.

## EXPLORATION MOVESEXPLORATION MOVES

The Forge is a vast, chaotic, and largely unexplored galaxy. Your  
sworn vows will take you through uncharted space, across the surface  
of inhospitable planets, and into the depths of foreboding derelicts,  
enigmatic alien vaults, and other perilous sites.

Will you survive these expeditions? What will they cost you? What wonders  
and horrors will you face? Use the exploration moves to find out.

### Undertake an Expedition

```
When you trailblaze a route through perilous space, journey over
hazardous terrain, or survey a mysterious site, give the expedition
a name and rank.
Then, for each segment of the expedition, envision your approach. If
you...
✴ Move at speed: Roll +edge
✴ Keep under the radar: Roll +shadow
✴ Stay vigilant: Roll +wits
On a strong hit, you reach a waypoint. Envision the location and mark
progress per the rank of the expedition.
On a weak hit, as above, but this progress costs you. Choose one.
✴ Suffer costs en route: Make a suffer move (-2), or two suffer
moves (-1).
✴ Face a peril at the waypoint: Envision what you encounter.
On a miss, you are waylaid by a crisis, or arrive at a waypoint to
confront an immediate hardship or threat. Do not mark progress, and
Pay the Price.
```

This is the foundational move for a trailblazing expedition. Make this move  
when you initially set off on a journey or delve into the unknown—whether  
you are in your STARSHIP, controlling a support vehicle, or traveling on  
foot. Then, each time you attempt to accrue progress, make the move  
again to resolve that segment of the expedition.

If you are instead making a journey through perilous known territory,  
such as following a mapped route or returning along an established path,  
make the Set a Course move to see how you fare with a single roll. If an  
expedition is mundane—a relatively short distance through safe territory—  
don’t make a move at all. Just envision the trip and jump to what happens  
when you arrive.

To begin an expedition, give it a name. Then, set the challenge using the  
standard ranks: troublesome, dangerous, formidable, extreme, or epic.  
Choose a rank appropriate to the fictional circumstances—the distance  
or scope, region, environment, threats, and your readiness. You should  
also consider the expedition’s importance in your story. If you want to  
move quicker to your destination, give it a lower rank. If this expedition  
represents an important aspect of your story, or you want to create space  
for encounters, events, and side quests, give it a higher rank. When you  
Finish an Expedition, you gain legacy rewards by marking progress on  
your discoveries legacy track per the rank of the expedition.

EXPLORATION MOVES 169

#### ENVISIONING YOUR APPROACH

For each segment of the expedition, envision your approach before rolling.  
The Undertake an Expedition move offers three options. Choose one.

```
✴ Move at speed: Roll +edge
✴ Keep under the radar: Roll +shadow
✴ Stay vigilant: Roll +wits
```

Your stat choice should be driven by the situation, your surroundings, your  
character’s abilities and methods, and the nature of your vehicle or gear.  
It’s fine to frame your approach to best fit a favored stat, but circumstances  
may force you to rely on a less optimal method.

```
Guiding your STARSHIP on an interstellar expedition, you find
yourself in a vast nebula wracked by energy storms. Your ship is
equipped with an ENGINE UPGRADE and rigged for speed, but the
nebula forces caution. You Undertake an Expedition and roll +wits
as you navigate carefully through the chaotic storms.
```

#### REACHING A WAYPOINT

Each segment of the expedition is marked by a waypoint. The locations,  
features, or encounters at a waypoint will create context for your  
exploration and the result of your moves.

Envision the details of a waypoint using the established nature of the  
expedition, the environment, and the outcome of the move. Or Ask the  
Oracle for inspiration. In Chapter 5, you’ll find procedures for generating  
locations for spaceborne expeditions (page 301), planets (page 307),  
derelicts (page 350), and precursor vaults (page 362).

For long-range spaceborne expeditions, your STARSHIP cruises the  
interstellar drifts, and each segment of the journey ends at a waypoint  
called an anchorage. Additionally, navigating complex areas of space  
such as asteroid fields or energy-wracked nebulas can provide waypoints  
in your expedition. See page 68 for details on interstellar travel and  
exploration in the Forge.

Depending on the pace of your story and your current situation, you may  
choose to focus on a waypoint. An extraordinary location or discovery  
might offer an opportunity to Explore a Waypoint. Or you can play out a  
scene not involving moves as you interact with your allies or the world.  
Mix it up. Some segments of travel will pass as a brief montage. Others  
are chances to zoom in, enriching your story and your setting. The moves  
will help prompt and guide your focus, but—like the director of a movie—  
you and your fellow players also have control. When it matters, when it’s  
interesting or dramatic, zoom in. Use those moments to reveal interesting  
details, introduce complications, or deepen your characters.

#### RESOLVING THE OUTCOME

On a strong hit, mark progress per the rank of the expedition as you reach  
the waypoint. For example, on a dangerous journey, mark two progress  
(filling two boxes on your progress track).

On a weak hit, you mark progress but must also suffer a cost. You’ll choose  
between two options:

```
✴ Suffer costs en route: Endure the wear and tear of the arduous
journey with one suffer move at a serious cost (-2) or two suffer
moves at a minor cost (-1). As appropriate to the situation, these suffer
moves can apply to any combination of yourself, a vehicle, an ally, or
a companion. This is the option to take if you want to quickly envision
a cost and move on.
✴ Face a peril at the waypoint: Introduce a danger that poses a hazard
but does not inflict an immediate cost. You’ll need to take action to
overcome or outwit this danger. This is the option to choose if you
want to zoom in and give the threat some focus.
```

When you have accumulated enough progress and are ready to wrap up  
an expedition, make the Finish an Expedition move.

When you Undertake an Expedition and score a miss, you do not mark  
progress and must Pay the Price. You might face an environmental hazard,  
an encounter with a threatening lifeform, an attack by foes, equipment  
failures, foreboding discoveries, or supernatural events. Decide what  
happens based on your current circumstances and surroundings, roll on  
the Pay the Price table, or Ask the Oracle for inspiration. Depending on  
the nature and focus of the cost, you can play out the event to see what  
happens, or summarize and apply consequences immediately.

```
You are exploring the surface of a grave world. When you Undertake
an Expedition and roll a miss, you envision the onset of a sudden
and violent acid rain. You are disoriented and lose the path, and do
not mark progress. Plus, you must now Face Danger to find shelter
before the corrosion compromises your environment suit. You
imagine each drop of rain sizzling against the visor of your helmet...
```

EXPLORATION MOVES 171

#### EXPEDITION PERILS

If you encounter a peril on an expedition because of a weak hit or miss,  
consider the nature of the danger as appropriate to the current situation.  
If you need inspiration, Ask the Oracle. You’ll find oracles to help inspire  
perils for various location types, including space (page 304), planets  
(page 320), derelicts (page 352 – 359 ), and precursor vaults (pages  
366 – 369 ). Abstract oracles such as Action and Theme (pages  
296 – 297 ) can also spark ideas for a perilous situation.

You might also encounter a peril—regardless of the outcome of the move  
—if you Ask the Oracle to reveal the details of a waypoint. The Forge, after  
all, is full of mystery and danger. In that case, you should let the approach  
you used to Undertake an Expedition (your stat choice, per the options in  
the move) and the outcome of your roll (strong hit, weak hit, or miss) help  
frame the situation as you face that unexpected danger.

For example, if you roll +shadow as you Undertake an Expedition on an  
interstellar journey, you are trying to keep your STARSHIP undetected by  
potential foes. If you arrive at a waypoint to find a horde of pirate ships,  
interpret what happens next with that framing in mind.

```
✴ If you rolled a strong hit, you are in control. Your stealthy approach
means the pirates don’t see you, and you are in position to observe
them or sneak away without risk—no move needed.
✴ If you rolled a weak hit, you’re at risk. They haven’t seen you, but you’ll
likely need to make a move such as Face Danger to avoid catching
their attention.
✴ If you rolled a miss, the pirates are already upon you. Enter the Fray.
```

**JUST ALONG FOR THE RIDE?**

If you and your allies aren’t an active participant in the planning or  
execution of the expedition—for example, you are passengers on a  
spacecraft operated by an NPC—you won’t Undertake an Expedition. The  
journey will be resolved in the fiction. You can Ask the Oracle to determine  
what happens en route or when you arrive.

**ALLIES AND EXPEDITIONS**

If you are on an expedition with allies, you share a progress track and  
one of you makes the Undertake an Expedition roll for each segment.  
The responsibility for leading the expedition can switch from segment to  
segment as you like.

An ally can assist by making the Aid Your Ally move. Perhaps they scout  
ahead on a planetside journey, or calibrate the eidolon drive on an  
interstellar voyage. Opportunities for downtime during the expedition  
might also allow you or your allies to pursue unrelated objectives, projects,  
and scenes. Everyone should offer occasional narrative color for what  
they do and see on the expedition, even if they are not making moves.

172 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### Explore a Waypoint

```
When you divert from an expedition to examine a notable location,
roll +wits.
On a strong hit, choose one. On a strong hit with a match, you may
instead Make a Discovery.
✴ Find an opportunity: Envision a favorable insight, situation,
resource, or encounter. Then, take +2 momentum.
✴ Gain progress: Mark progress on your expedition, per its rank.
On a weak hit, you uncover something interesting, but it is bound up
in a peril or reveals an ominous aspect of this place. Envision what
you encounter. Then, take +1 momentum.
On a miss, you encounter an immediate hardship or threat, and
must Pay the Price. On a miss with a match, you may instead
Confront Chaos.
```

When you encounter a promising waypoint in the midst of an expedition—  
and choose to explore that location in depth, make this move to see what  
you find. This move is best used sparingly for remarkable or unusual  
locations, rather than as a matter of course.

```
You are delving an abandoned mining facility deep in the heart of
a crystalline asteroid. The site is full of dark passages and dormant
industrial equipment. But you come across a high-tech research
lab where the power is still active. What is this place? You Explore
a Waypoint to take a closer look.
```

If you roll a strong hit and choose to find an opportunity, take a moment to  
bring what you find to life. What is it? How can it help you? The opportunity  
should make sense in the context of the location and the purpose of your  
exploration. It might also enable additional moves, such as finding a secure  
spot to Repair, or discovering valuable salvage you can use to Resupply.

If you instead choose to gain progress on a strong hit, envision how you  
earn this advantage. Is it a shortcut, helpful data, insight into the nature  
of the region, or some other discovery that speeds you along your way?

On a weak hit, you encounter something curious or helpful, but also face  
an immediate peril or learn something that foreshadows future danger.  
Envision what you encounter and what you do next. Trying to learn more  
or leverage this opportunity may force you into deeper peril.

On a miss, your exploration has gone wrong or uncovered an unexpected  
hazard. You gain no benefit and must Pay the Price.

174 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

#### PERILS AND OPPORTUNITIES

If you reveal a peril or opportunity as you Explore a Waypoint, you can Ask  
the Oracle for insight. There are oracle tables for perils and opportunities  
for several common environments, including space (page 304 – 305 ),  
planets (pages 320 – 321 ), derelicts (pages 352 – 359 ), and precursor  
vaults (pages 367 – 369 ).

Most results on those peril tables are a setup for a new threat or  
complication. You encounter an obstacle that must be overcome, or a foe  
who must be dealt with, or a mystery that must be solved. If you need  
clarification for an abstract or suggestive result, Ask the Oracle. Then,  
zoom in and resolve the situation. If a move is triggered, make it.

Other results as you encounter a peril or Pay the Price may suggest an  
immediate consequence, such as making a suffer move (page 198).  
If so, make it happen. Varying the focus and nature of the dangers you  
encounter will help you manage the pace of your story. If it’s interesting  
and dramatic, zoom in. Otherwise, apply the consequence and move on.

**DISCOVERIES AND CHAOS**

If you roll a match as you Explore a Waypoint, you can choose to encounter  
something wondrous or dreadful. On a strong hit with a match, Make a  
Discovery. On a miss with a match, Confront Chaos. Those moves offer  
prompts for the nature of what you uncover and allow you to mark rewards  
on your discoveries legacy track.

This is a choice, not a mandate. Even on a match, you can choose to  
resolve the Explore a Waypoint move using the default outcomes.

**MANAGING THE SCOPE OF A WAYPOINT**

The scale of your exploration may vary. On an interstellar expedition, you  
might Explore a Waypoint and resolve a days-long survey of an entire  
planet with one roll of the dice. Inside an alien vault, the same move can  
represent your examination of a single chamber in a matter of minutes.  
Envision your actions and outcome as appropriate to the situation and the  
level of story focus you give to the location.

You can even choose to spotlight a notable waypoint by making your  
exploration of that location an expedition of its own. In that case, you do  
not Explore a Waypoint. Instead, Undertake an Expedition. You are nesting  
one expedition within another, each with its own progress track.

```
During a planetside expedition, you encounter a ruined settlement.
If you delve into the remains of this place, you can Explore
a Waypoint to quickly resolve the search from a zoomed out
perspective. Or you can choose to Undertake an Expedition within
the site, giving the survey its own rank and progress track.
```

EXPLORATION MOVES 175

### Make a Discovery

```
When your exploration of a waypoint uncovers something
wondrous, roll on the table below or choose one. Then, envision
the nature of the discovery and how it is revealed. When you first
experience or engage with the discovery, you and your allies may
mark two ticks on your discoveries legacy track.
```

```
1–4 Advanced technology waiting to be harnessed or salvaged
5–8 Ancient archive or message
9–10 Artificial consciousness evolved to a higher state
11–12 Clues to a crucial resource or uncharted domain
13–14 Envoy from another time or reality
15–22Extraordinary natural phenomenon
23–24First contact with intelligent life
25–26Gateway to another time or alternate reality
27–28Key to unlocking a language or method of communication
29–34Lost or hidden people
35–42Majestic or unusual lifeforms
43–46Marvel of ancient engineering
47–50Miraculously preserved artifact or specimen
51–56Monumental architecture or artistry of an ancient civilization
57–62Mysterious device or artifact of potential value
63–66New understanding of an enduring mystery
67–68Pathway or means of travel to a distant location
69–70Person or lifeform with phenomenal abilities
71–78Place of awe-inspiring beauty
79–86Rare and valuable resource
87–88Safeguarded or idyllic location
89–90Visions or prophesies of the future
91–100Roll Twice
```

You may make this move only when you Explore a Waypoint and  
roll a strong hit with a match. This represents uncovering something  
extraordinary, the nature of which you’ll define by choosing or rolling on  
the table. This is a dramatic, rare event, worthy of focus in your story.  
Take a moment to envision the result or talk it through with others at your  
table. The discovery should deepen your understanding of the setting,  
introduce revelations that may contradict accepted truths, or reveal a rare  
and valuable treasure.

Once you’ve established the nature of the discovery and interacted with it  
in the fiction, you and your allies may mark two ticks on your discoveries  
legacy track.

176 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### Confront Chaos

```
When your exploration of a waypoint uncovers something dreadful,
decide the number of aspects: one, two, or three. Roll that number of
times or choose that number of aspects on the table below. Then,
envision how the encounter begins.
For each result, when you first confront that aspect within the scope
of the encounter, you and your allies may mark one tick on your
discoveries legacy track.
```

```
1–4 Baneful weapon of mass destruction
5–9 Cataclysmic environmental effects
10–12 Dead given unnatural life
13–17 Destructive lifeform of monstrous proportion
18–20Dread hallucinations or illusions
21–24Harbingers of an imminent invasion
25–27Horde of insatiable hunger or fury
28–32Horrific lifeforms of inscrutable purpose
33–36Impostors in human form
37–41Machines made enemy
42–45Malignant contagion or parasite
46–50Messenger or signal with a dire warning
51–53Passage to a grim alternate reality
54–58People corrupted by chaos
59–63Powerful distortions of time or space
64–68Signs of an impending catastrophe
69–72Site of a baffling disappearance
73–77Site of a horrible disaster
78–82Site of terrible carnage
83–87Technology nullified or made unstable
88–92Technology warped for dark purpose
93–96Vault of dread technology or power
97–100Worshipers of great and malevolent powers
```

You may make this move only when you Explore a Waypoint and roll a miss  
with a match. You have stumbled across a dire discovery or inadvertently  
unleashed something horrific, the nature of which may have campaign-  
shaking ramifications.

Choose a number of aspects (one, two, or three), and pick or roll that  
number of times on the table. Then, envision how this threat manifests. The  
good news? Even chaos offers knowledge; you and your allies may mark  
one tick on your discoveries legacy track for each aspect you encounter.

EXPLORATION MOVES 177

### Finish an Expedition

```
Progress Move
When your expedition comes to an end, roll the challenge dice and
compare to your progress.
On a strong hit, you reach your destination or complete your survey.
Mark a reward on your discoveries legacy track per expedition’s rank:
troublesome=1 tick; dangerous=2 ticks; formidable=1 box; extreme=2
boxes; epic=3 boxes. Any allies who shared this expedition also mark
the reward.
On a weak hit, as above, but you face an unforeseen complication at
the end of your expedition. Make the legacy reward one rank lower
(none for a troublesome expedition), and envision what you encounter.
On a miss, your destination is lost to you, or you come to understand
the true nature or cost of the expedition. Envision what happens and
choose one.
✴ Abandon the expedition: Envision the cost of this setback and
Pay the Price.
✴ Return to the expedition: Roll both challenge dice, take the lowest
value, and clear that number of progress boxes. Then, raise the
expedition’s rank by one (if not already epic).
```

When you have accrued progress on an expedition’s progress track and  
are ready to complete the expedition, make this move.

Since this is a progress move (page 42), tally the number of filled boxes  
on your progress track. This is your progress score. Only add fully filled  
boxes (those with four ticks). Then, roll your challenge dice, compare to  
your progress score, and resolve a strong hit, weak hit, or miss as normal.  
You may not burn momentum on this roll, and you are not affected by  
negative momentum.

If you are on an expedition with allies, one of you makes this move. Each  
of you benefit (or suffer) from the narrative outcome, and you mark legacy  
rewards together.

On a strong hit, you complete your survey or reach your destination. Mark  
progress on your discoveries legacy track per the rank of the expedition.  
Then, consider the impact of your discoveries. If this was an interstellar  
voyage, did you trailblaze a new passage that you and others can follow?  
Did you uncover resources or encounter mysteries that will have a lasting  
impact on your setting? How has the expedition changed you?

178 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

On a weak hit, the journey or survey is complete, but something complicates  
the end of your expedition. Things are not what you expected, or a new  
danger reveals itself. Envision what you encounter, and make the legacy  
reward one rank lower. Then, play to see what happens.

On a hit, also consider how the expedition impacts your vows. If it serves  
as a milestone on a quest, make the Reach a Milestone move. See page  
181 for details on pairing an expedition with a quest.

Once an expedition is complete, future travel along this route or within this  
site is streamlined. If you head back the way you came, or return in the  
future along the same path, you can Set a Course.

On a miss, something has gone wrong. You realize you are off-course,  
relied on bad information, or face a turn of events that undermines the  
expedition or makes its cost too great. Depending on the circumstances  
and your choice, this might mean your expedition ends in failure, or that  
you push on while clearing some of your filled progress and raising the  
expedition’s rank.

```
On the rugged, forested world of Nemus, you are on an expedition
to reach a fabled site called the Heart of the Ancients. This massive
floating island, held aloft by mysterious forces, is said to contain
a precursor vault with untold technological riches. But when you
Finish Your Expedition, you roll a miss. You envision finding not a
vault, but a map. The journey is not yet complete...
```

EXPLORATION MOVES 179

### Set a Course

```
When you follow a known route through perilous space, across
hazardous terrain, or within a mysterious site, roll +supply.
On a strong hit, you reach your destination and the situation there
favors you. Take +1 momentum.
On a weak hit, you arrive, but face a cost or complication. Choose one.
✴ Suffer costs en route: Make a suffer move (-2), or two suffer
```

## COMBAT MOVES

```
✴ Face a complication at the destination: Envision what you
encounter.
On a miss, you are waylaid by a significant threat, and must Pay
the Price. If you overcome this obstacle, you may push on safely to
your destination.
```

When you are journeying along a known (but still perilous) path, make  
this move. Unlike Undertake an Expedition, which is resolved in individual  
segments, Set a Course condenses the narrative and mechanics of the  
entire journey into a single roll of the dice.

For interstellar travel, plotted routes through the chaos of the Forge are  
called passages. When traveling in your STARSHIP, you can Set a Course  
if you are following one of these charted paths. You’ll establish your  
own passages when you successfully Undertake an Expedition through  
interstellar space, and you might have opportunities to obtain navigational  
data for a specific route through other means. See page 68 for more on  
interstellar travel within the Forge.

For planetside travel and surveys within sites, you can Set a Course  
when you are journeying through a known area or along a previously  
established route.

On a strong hit, you arrive safely at your destination. Hours, days, or weeks  
will have passed as appropriate to the scope of the journey, but the trip  
was uneventful. Envision how you managed the journey and what you did  
with any downtime.

On a weak hit, you reach your destination, but the journey extracts a price.  
Choose an option from the move and envision the cost or complication.

On a miss, you are waylaid by a significant danger en route. Envision  
what you encounter and do what you must to overcome this threat. If  
you survive, you can push on safely to your destination without making  
another move.

180 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### Combining Expeditions and Quests

Typically, an expedition is an obstacle to be overcome in a related quest.  
When you Finish an Expedition, you might also Reach a Milestone on a  
vow. But what do you do when the objective of an expedition is also the  
focus of a vow?

```
You Swear an Iron Vow to transport urgently needed medical
supplies to a remote outpost. But a clan of drift pirates stalk the
spaceways in this sector, and other dangers surely await in the
depths of the Forge.
```

In this example, the expedition destination and the object of a quest are  
essentially the same. However, you still maintain separate progress tracks  
for each. Progress on your expedition is not marked as progress on your  
vow; instead, you find opportunities to Reach a Milestone as you prepare,  
undertake, and complete the expedition.

First, consider what obstacles you must deal with as you ready yourself for  
the expedition. Do you need to obtain navigational data? Are there forces  
that seek to prevent you from setting off? Overcoming these obstacles  
can allow you to Reach a Milestone in your quest.

During the expedition, manage your progress for the expedition and  
the vow separately. When you successfully Undertake an Expedition,  
mark progress on that track. In parallel, as you gain new information  
and overcome obstacles and foes related to the quest, you can Reach a  
Milestone and mark progress on your vow.

Finally, the moment when you successfully Finish an Expedition will  
probably serve as a milestone in your quest. Depending on the situation,  
you may face obstacles at your destination that you must overcome before  
you can Fulfill Your Vow. There may be enemies protecting the objective,  
for example, or a hazard you must bypass. These obstacles are additional  
milestones in your quest.

In fact, adding obstacles once you Finish an Expedition can accomplish  
two things: It creates additional milestones to fill out your vow progress  
track, and can make the climax of your quest and expedition more  
dramatic and exciting.

## COMBAT MOVESCOMBAT MOVES

The Forge is a perilous galaxy. Factions fight for control. Pirates hunt the  
spaceways. Raiders prey on vulnerable settlements. Dangerous creatures  
and chaotic terrors stalk the unwary. Dreaded foes and powerful forces  
will oppose your sworn quests. Eventually, you’ll be forced to fight.

When you face one or more foes in high-stakes, action-oriented conflict,  
use the combat moves. These moves encompass on-foot action and

Before we dive into the combat moves, there are a few terms and concepts  
to keep in mind for managing combat challenges. See the following pages  
for details.

182 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### Combat Objectives

Most combat challenges are driven by something other than simply  
inflicting physical violence against your foes. What are you trying to  
achieve? These are your objectives. For example:

```
✴ Escape the swarm of pirate ships
✴ Upload the stolen data
✴ Repel the raiders
✴ Cover the evacuation of the settlement
✴ Shut down the main reactor
```

Much like quests, connections, and expeditions, combat is managed  
through progress tracks and resolved with a progress move. You’ll set  
one or more objectives when you Enter the Fray by naming them and  
giving them a rank. Then, you accrue progress toward those objectives by  
making combat moves. When you are ready to resolve an objective, Take  
Decisive Action.

A combat challenge involves action-oriented conflict, but it is not  
necessarily lethal. You should envision the actions of your character and  
your foes as appropriate to their intent and capabilities. For example, a  
Strike can be framed as a bruising punch, a shot from a stun gun, or a hail  
of deadly gunfire. But if you have an objective and neither side is willing  
or in a position to fight for it, that challenge is probably best represented  
through other moves. Combat is dangerous, messy, and chaotic. It’s often  
a last resort.

COMBAT MOVES 183

### Combat Position

In a fight, your position is defined as one of two states:

```
✴ When you are in control, you make proactive moves to gain advantage
and inflict forceful damage or destruction.
✴ When you are in a bad spot, you must make reactive moves to get in
position, overcome hazards, and thwart attacks.
```

Some combat moves are inherently proactive or offensive and can only  
be made when you are in control. Others are reactive or defensive and  
are made when you are in a bad spot. The text of each combat move  
will describe the requirements (phrased as “when you are in control” or  
“when you are in a bad spot”), and the outcome for those moves will set  
your new position.

You may also make moves that aren’t specific to combat, such as when  
you Endure Harm to resist injury or Repair your vehicle in the midst of a  
fight. To determine whether a move puts you in control or in a bad spot,  
follow these guidelines (unless a move tells you otherwise):

```
✴ When you score a strong hit, you are in control.
✴ When you score a weak hit or miss, you are in a bad spot.
```

**POSITION AND ALLIES**

You and your allies track position independently. Shift the focus between  
characters and make moves when they are triggered. A character who is  
in control makes proactive moves to cause damage or setup advantages.  
A character in a bad spot defends against attacks, attempts to overcome  
obstacles, and tries to get back into the fight.

Combat is a fluid situation. Talk out what happens as if moving a virtual  
camera around your imagined scene. Bring the chaos of the fight to life.  
Use a dramatic moment to jump to a different character. Keep things  
moving to give everyone time in the spotlight.

**POSITION AND FOES**

You do not track a position or make moves for your opponents. When  
you are in a bad spot, NPCs take actions in the fiction of the scene that  
force you to react. When you are in control, you make proactive moves  
to achieve your objectives and envision how your foes try to thwart you.

When you’re not sure what an enemy does next, particularly when they  
have you in a bad spot, Ask the Oracle. The foes in Chapter 4 (page 250)  
include traits and tactics to help envision their actions. The Combat Action  
oracle (page 383) offers prompts you can interpret as appropriate to the  
nature of the enemy and your objective.

184 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### Combat Range

When you Strike or Clash, the stat you roll is determined by your range  
relative to your foes: close quarters (+iron) or at a distance (+edge).  
This applies to vehicle and personal combat. Most exchanges of gunfire  
or vehicle-to-vehicle barrages are at a distance. When you are on foot  
at close quarters, you fight hand-to-hand or use ranged weapons at a  
brutally close range. In a vehicle, close quarters can mean point-blank  
strafing runs, short-range volleys, and ramming.

Changing your range might require a move to overcome obstacles, or is  
simply woven into the narrative of other actions. Enemy maneuvers can  
also change the range. For example, if you Strike a charging creature with  
gunfire and roll a miss, you’ll likely find yourself at close quarters.

Apart from that, there’s no need to track the geography of combatants in  
combat. Keep it chaotic and exciting. Envision a fight as a cinematic set  
piece with dynamic movement, complex terrain, environmental effects,  
unexpected dangers, and cunning foes.

### Combat Resources

The gear, companions, and vehicles you bring to bear provide narrative  
detail for a combat challenge and frame your ability to make moves. When  
you act to achieve your objectives, take these resources into account.

Some of your combat capabilities might be represented by assets. But  
most are simply an aspect of your character and the situation. How are  
you armed and armored? Who stands beside you? What tools of war or  
natural abilities does your foe wield? What hazards or advantages does  
the environment present? Weave these elements into the fiction of the  
scene to create a dramatic, dynamic challenge.

### Combat Scale and Difficulty

Take the relative scale and power of the combatants into account when  
setting the rank of objectives. If you are well-prepared and in a strong  
position to achieve an objective, set its rank appropriately low. If you are  
outmatched, make it higher. A rank of formidable is a good default. When  
you Enter the Fray, adjust it from there to reflect situational advantages  
or drawbacks. Or use multiple objectives to ramp up the complexity and  
danger of the fight, especially when playing with allies. Then, when you  
must Pay the Price during combat, the cost should reinforce the danger of  
the situation and the relative power of your foes.

In some cases, the scale of a foe will make direct assaults or defenses  
impossible. Your pistol is harmless against a titanic beast. Your SNUB  
FIGHTER is a minor nuisance against a massive dreadnought. Remember:  
fiction first. If you aren’t in a position to take an action, envision another  
approach. If all else fails, you may need to Face Defeat.

COMBAT MOVES 185

### Battle Stations!

The combat moves can depict any scale of action-oriented conflict—even  
the clash of mighty starships. If you are playing solo and at the helm of  
your STARSHIP or a support vehicle, you fly and fight independently. In  
co-op and guided play, you and your allies work together to survive.

There are no strict shipboard combat roles in Starforged. You’ll react to  
threats and take action as appropriate to your character’s nature and  
capabilities. But this doesn’t mean a character who serves as a HEALER  
is stuck waiting for a patient in the medical bay. On a ship with a small  
crew, everyone is expected to lend a hand in a crisis. Get in a gun turret.  
Operate the sensor console. Rush through smoke-filled corridors to put  
out a fire. You are broadly capable and can assist outside your specialties.

To create a more exciting and involving shipboard combat challenge,  
let the narrative twists and turns of the fight create predicaments and  
opportunities for the crew. Here are some examples of shipboard combat  
tasks for co-op and guided play. In solo play, you may need to jump  
between or prioritize actions.

```
✴ Command: Coordinate, make plans, provide motivation or comfort
✴ Countermeasures: Deploy electronic countermeasures, defend
against incoming missiles
✴ Damage Control: Resist damage, suppress fires, patch hull breaches,
fix systems, tend to mechanical companions
✴ Engineering: Tune engines, manage power, bypass failing systems
✴ Escort: Operate a support vehicle
✴ Gunnery: Energize or ready weapons, lock on targets, fire weapons
✴ Infantry: Repel boarders, launch raids against enemy vessels
✴ Medical: Tend to the wounded
✴ Piloting: Maneuver to get in position, line up a shot, evade incoming
fire, avoid obstacles, pursue or escape targets
✴ Sensors: Survey surroundings, scan foes, track and identify targets,
plot navigation paths
✴ Systems: Manage communications, jam or hack enemy systems,
defend against electronic threats
```

Characters who are in control will envision their actions through proactive  
moves such as Gain Ground or Strike. Characters in a bad spot need to  
get in position, overcome obstacles, avoid threats, and fight back using  
moves such as React Under Fire and Clash. If you are in control and  
directly supporting another character, you can Aid Your Ally. In addition,  
suffer moves (page 198) and recover moves (page 208) will come into  
play as the crew deals with harm, stress, and damage.

186 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

```
Archer and Luna are playing Starforged in co-op mode. They are
aboard their STARSHIP, flying through an asteroid field, on the run
from a pack of pirate ships. Their objective: escape the pirates.
Both of them are in a bad spot. Luna is in a gun turret. Archer is in
the pilot’s seat, weaving through spaceborne rocks.
“A big asteroid tumbles right into our path,” Archer says. “I’m going
to React Under Fire to avoid it.”
He rolls +edge, and scores a strong hit. He is now in control.
“Can you fly in a straight line, maybe?” Luna says. She is envisioning
her character struggling to aim at the pursuing ships in the midst of
Archer’s frantic maneuvering.
“Since I’m in control now,” Archer says, “let me see if I can get you
lined up for a shot. I’m going to make the Aid Your Ally move with
Gain Ground.”
Archer rolls +edge again, and scores a weak hit. Per the Aid Your
Ally move, this outcome puts Luna in control, but Archer is now in a
bad spot. “I get us in perfect position,” he says, “but I’ve sacrificed
some speed and the pirates are gaining.”
Luna takes the momentum bonus from Archer’s Gain Ground
outcome, lines up a shot on the lead pursuer, and rolls to Strike.
Unfortunately, it’s a miss. Things have gone from bad to worse.
“I take the shot,” she says, “but the lead ship dodges and all I
manage to do is knock a chunk out of a space rock. The pirates are
firing back. Since I need to Pay the Price, let’s say we take a hit?”
“Yeah, the ship buckles as they rake gunfire across the hull. Should
we roll to Withstand Damage?”
“Actually,” Luna says, “let’s hold onto our ship integrity for now
and throw a new complication into the mix. Maybe there’s a blown
panel and a fire breaks out. If we don’t manage to deal with it, then
we need to Withstand Damage.”
“Yeah, so the ship rocks from the gunfire. An alarm buzzes in the
cockpit. I holler over comms, ‘we’ve got a fire in the engine room!’”
“I’m on it!” Luna says. “I drop out of the turret, climb down the
ladder, and head for the engine room. I’ll React Under Fire when
I get there. Meanwhile, those pirates are closing in. What are you
doing in the cockpit?
“You mean besides praying?” Archer says.
```

COMBATCOMBAT MOVES MOVES 187187

### Enter the Fray

```
When you initiate combat or are forced into a fight, envision your
objective and give it a rank. If the combat includes discrete challenges
or phases, set an objective with a rank for each.
Then, roll to see if you are in control. If you are...
✴ On the move: Roll +edge
✴ Facing off against your foe: Roll +heart
✴ In the thick of it at close quarters: Roll +iron
✴ Preparing to act against an unaware foe: Roll +shadow
✴ Caught in a trap or sizing up the situation: Roll +wits
On a strong hit, take both. On a weak hit, choose one.
✴ Take +2 momentum
✴ You are in control
On a miss, the fight begins with you in a bad spot.
```

Make this move when high-stakes combat is joined. First, define one  
or more objectives (page 183) and give each a rank: troublesome,  
dangerous, formidable, extreme, or epic. The foes, environment, and the  
nature of your goal can all have an impact on the rank of an objective.  
If you are outmatched, make the rank higher. If you are well-prepared  
and in a position of strength, make it lower. You might even use separate  
objectives and progress tracks to represent distinct stages, goals, or foes.

Once you’ve set your objectives, envision the situation and roll with the  
appropriate stat. The result determines your position at the start of the  
fight: in control or in a bad spot (page 184). On a strong hit, you are in  
control and gain momentum. On a weak hit, choose one of those starting  
advantages. On a miss, you are in a bad spot; you’re caught unaware, put  
on the defense, or need to maneuver to get into the fight.

If you are fighting alongside allies, each of you rolls to determine your  
individual position as you Enter the Fray. Then, you and the other players  
envision the scene, describe your intent, and play to see what happens.  
You can share objectives, although you might focus on different tasks  
within the scope of each objective.

```
You and your ally locate a precursor data archive in the midst of
an ancient, devastated city. You need time to decipher the cryptic
controls of the archive, but are suddenly attacked by hostile, insect-
like creatures. When you Enter the Fray, you set an objective to
retrieve the precursor data. Your ally will help make progress on
that objective by fending off the swarm.
```

188 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### Gain Ground

```
When you are in control and take action in a fight to reinforce your
position or move toward an objective, envision your approach and
roll. If you are...
✴ In pursuit, fleeing, or maneuvering: Roll +edge
✴ Charging boldly into action, coming to the aid of others,
negotiating, or commanding: Roll +heart
✴ Gaining leverage with force, powering through, or making a
threat: Roll +iron
✴ Hiding, preparing an ambush, or misdirecting: Roll +shadow
✴ Coordinating a plan, studying a situation, or cleverly gaining
leverage: Roll +wits
On a hit, you stay in control. On a strong hit, choose two. On a weak
hit, choose one.
✴ Mark progress
✴ Take +2 momentum
✴ Add +1 on your next move (not a progress move)
On a miss, your foe gains the upper hand, the fight moves to a new
location, or you encounter a new peril. You are in a bad spot and must
Pay the Price.
```

This move is the combat-focused version of Secure an Advantage, used  
when you are in control to build advantage against a foe or move toward  
your objective.

When you Gain Ground, picture the situation. Consider the environment,  
the gear and tech you bring to bear, and your own abilities. Consider  
your enemy, and their tactics and readiness. What can you use to your  
advantage? Envision your action, then make the move.

```
In the upper atmosphere of a Jovian world, your STARSHIP is
attacked and pursued by a swarm of enemy fighters. You decide to
Gain Ground by hiding in an expanse of storm-wracked clouds. Will
this throw some of them off your trail? You roll +shadow to find out.
```

Since a hit on Gain Ground includes an option to mark progress, you can  
achieve your objective in a fight without relying solely (or possibly at all)  
on direct physical violence. This move—unlike others—also lets you stay  
in control on a weak hit. It’s a powerful option to build momentum and  
progress. If you are instead acting to inflict direct harm or damage while  
you are in control, make the Strike move.

190 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### React Under Fire

```
When you are in a bad spot and take action in a fight to avoid
danger or overcome an obstacle, envision your approach and roll.
If you are...
✴ In pursuit, fleeing, dodging, getting back into position, or taking
cover: Roll +edge
✴ Remaining stalwart against fear or temptation: Roll +heart
✴ Blocking or diverting with force, or taking the hit: Roll +iron
✴ Moving into hiding or creating a distraction: Roll +shadow
✴ Changing the plan, finding a way out, or cleverly bypassing an
obstacle: Roll +wits
On a strong hit, you succeed and are in control. Take +1 momentum.
On a weak hit, you avoid the worst of the danger or overcome the
obstacle, but not without a cost. Make a suffer move (-1). You stay in
a bad spot.
On a miss, the situation worsens. You stay in a bad spot and must Pay
the Price.
```

React Under Fire is the combat-focused version of Face Danger, and is  
used instead of that move in a fight. When you are in a bad spot and try  
to get out of harm’s way, focus on defense, resist a foe’s attempt to gain  
advantage, or get past an obstacle, make this move.

```
You are chasing an enemy agent through the corridors of an orbital
station. You roll a miss as you Gain Ground, and are now in a bad
spot. You envision rounding a corner to find the agent unleashing
a spray of gunfire. You React Under Fire by leaping behind cover,
and roll +edge.
```

React Under Fire is often done in response to a foe who is trying to  
gain advantage through an action other than a direct attack. The enemy  
commander taunts you over the ship’s comms, trying to fluster you or  
provoke a reckless response. A trooper moves into position to get a shot  
at you from cover. A creature leaps at you, putting you off-balance for a  
follow-up attack. What do you do? Envision it, then make the move.

If you are in a bad spot and choose to fight back, you should instead Clash  
to resolve your action. React Under Fire is often less risky, since you can  
use a favored stat, the penalty on a weak hit is relatively mild, and a strong  
hit can put you in good position for a follow-up move. But unlike Clash,  
you won’t have an opportunity to mark progress on a hit.

COMBAT MOVES 191

### Strike

```
When you are in control and assault a foe at close quarters, roll
+iron; when you attack at a distance, roll +edge.
On a strong hit, mark progress twice. You dominate your foe and stay
in control.
On a weak hit, mark progress twice, but you expose yourself to
danger. You are in a bad spot.
On a miss, the fight turns against you. You are in a bad spot and must
Pay the Price.
```

Make this move when you are in control and act to inflict harm or damage  
against your foe.

Narratively, this move might represent a focused moment in time—a quick  
scuffle, a carefully aimed rifle shot, or the flight of a missile. Or it can  
depict an extended exchange as you attempt to keep your opponent on  
the defensive. Zoom in and out as appropriate to the scope of the fight.

```
You are in the gun turret of your starship, helping fight a pack of
enemy fighters. You are in control, and holding your shot until the
last possible moment as a fighter swoops by at close range. You
swivel the cannon, press the trigger, and Strike +iron to unleash a
barrage of devastating fire.
```

On a strong hit, you strike true. Envision the outcome and mark progress  
twice per the rank of the objective. For example, against a dangerous  
objective you would mark two boxes twice, or four full progress boxes.  
Any instance of “mark progress” gained through an asset ability stack with  
that result, allowing you to mark additional ticks or boxes per the rank of  
the challenge. See page 41 for details.

Narratively, a strong hit represents wounding or damaging an enemy, or  
wearing them down. You are in control and can envision your next action.

On a weak hit, you’ve done some damage but are overextended or gave  
your enemy an opportunity. You mark progress twice, and are in a bad  
spot. How does your foe respond?

On a miss, you must Pay the Price. Envision a price that fits the  
circumstances. Your opponent strikes back, and you Endure Harm  
or Withstand Damage. You sacrifice position or advantage and Lose  
Momentum. A companion or ally is put in harm’s way. Your weapon is out  
of ammo. A new danger reveals itself. Let the outcome flow out of the  
fiction, or roll on the Pay the Price table to see what happens.

192 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### Clash

```
When you are in a bad spot and fight back against a foe at close
quarters, roll +iron; when you exchange fire at a distance, roll +edge.
On a strong hit, mark progress twice. You overwhelm your foe and
are in control.
On a weak hit, mark progress, but you are dealt a counterblow or
setback. You stay in a bad spot and must Pay the Price.
On a miss, your foe dominates this exchange. You stay in a bad spot
and must Pay the Price.
```

Make this move when you are in a bad spot and choose to fight back  
against your foe.

First, envision your action and the fiction of the exchange. Is this a focused,  
dramatic moment where you each seek an opening? Or is it a flurry of  
attacks and counters, advances and retreats? The outcome of the move  
determines whether your foe presses their advantage, or if you turn the  
tide and take control.

```
You are attempting to hold off enemy troopers as your ally
frantically preps the STARSHIP for launch. Your foes burst through
the docking bay entrance, firing wildly at you and the ship. You
level your guns and Clash to shoot back, rolling +edge since you
are at a distance.
```

On a strong hit, you come out on top. As with the Strike move, mark  
progress twice per the rank of the objective.

On a weak hit, you manage to inflict harm or damage and mark progress,  
but stay in a bad spot. Plus, you must Pay the Price. The cost you suffer  
can be to Endure Harm or Withstand Damage. Or you may face some  
other dramatic outcome as appropriate to the current situation and your  
foe’s intent.

The result of a weak hit as you Clash—whether mechanical or purely  
narrative—should be more dire than the merely troublesome price you  
face if you React Under Fire and score a weak hit. The weak hit with Clash  
enables you to mark progress, but comes at a cost. This is the risk and  
reward of wading into the fight.

On a miss, you fail, don’t mark progress, stay in a bad spot, and must Pay  
the Price. This fight is turning against you.

COMBAT MOVES 193

### Take Decisive Action

```
Progress Move
When you seize an objective in a fight, envision how you take decisive
action. Then, roll the challenge dice and compare to your progress.
If you are in control, check the result as normal. If you are in a bad
spot, count a strong hit without a match as a weak hit, and a weak hit
as a miss.
On a strong hit, you prevail. Take +1 momentum. If any objectives
remain and the fight continues, you are in control.
On a weak hit, you achieve your objective, but not without cost. Roll
on the table below or choose one. If the fight continues, you are in a
bad spot.
```

```
1–40 It’s worse than you thought: Make a suffer move (-2)
41–52Victory is short-lived: A new peril or foe appears
53–64You face collateral damage: Something is lost, damaged,
or broken
65–76Others pay the price: Someone else suffers the cost
77–88Others won’t forget: You are marked for vengeance
89–100It gets complicated: The true nature of a foe or objective
is revealed
```

```
On a miss, you are defeated or your objective is lost. Pay the Price.
```

Your objective is at hand, and you make a final effort to see it done. Do you  
succeed, or does the fight turn against you? Make this move to find out.

This is a dramatic moment. Focus on it. Envision your intent. You reach  
the comm console and prepare to transmit the stolen plans. You arm a  
torpedo and target the station’s vulnerable exhaust port. You seize the  
forgespawn brood mother in the articulated claws of your exosuit. You  
level your gun at the enemy troopers and demand their surrender.

Since this is a progress move (page 42), tally the number of filled boxes  
on your quest progress track. This is your progress score. Only add fully  
filled boxes (those with four ticks). Then, roll your challenge dice, compare  
to the progress score, and resolve a strong hit, weak hit, or miss. You may  
not burn momentum, and you are not affected by negative momentum.  
If you are in a bad spot as you make this move, you are not poised for  
success; unless you roll a strong hit with a match, you must shift the result  
down one level.

On a strong hit, the objective is achieved. If you still face other objectives  
(using separate progress tracks), you are in control and the fight continues.

194 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

If you score a weak hit, the victory comes at a cost. Roll or choose an  
outcome from the table. Then, consider the narrative implications of this  
outcome and what happens next. If the fight continues with any remaining  
objectives, you are in a bad spot.

```
You are aboard your ROVER, speeding along a rocky ravine, under
attack by an enemy ship. You are ready to Take Decisive Action,
and envision driving into a cave to throw off your pursuer. You
make the progress roll and score a weak hit—a success, but at a
cost. You pick the “victory is short-lived” outcome, and envision the
cave entrance collapsing behind you, trapping you in the darkness.
```

On a miss, your final effort is undone through a surprising turn of events or  
dramatic failure, and you must Pay the Price. If this was the only objective,  
the fight is lost. Envision what this means and the cost you must pay as  
appropriate to your objective and the intentions of your foes.

If you score a miss and other objectives are still achievable, you can deal  
with the cost of this failure and press on. If those objectives are out of  
reach, you should instead Face Defeat.

When you and your allies are fighting for a common objective, you share  
a progress track. Anyone involved with the objective can instigate the  
final push and Take Decisive Action, with other allies describing how they  
contribute to the move. If you then score a weak hit or miss, consider the  
impact for the group and who suffers the cost.

COMBAT MOVES 195

### Face Defeat

```
When you abandon or are deprived of an objective, envision the
consequence of this failure, clear the objective, and Pay the Price.
If the fight continues, you may create a new objective and give it a
rank to represent the changing situation. If any objectives remain, the
fight continues and you are in a bad spot.
```

Making the Take Decisive Action move is not the only way to resolve a  
combat objective. You can instead flee, surrender, shift to focus on another  
objective, or find yourself without any chance of success. When you can  
no longer bear the cost of the fight, or an objective falls out of reach, make  
this move.

Face Defeat does not require a roll. Instead, you envision how you  
abandon or are deprived of your goal, clear that objective, and Pay the  
Price. The cost you pay can be purely narrative as you deal with the fallout  
of this defeat. Or you might make a suffer move to represent an impact on  
your immediate condition or readiness—such as suffering stress, facing  
harm or damage, or losing momentum.

If you have multiple objectives and do not Face Defeat for all of them, the  
fight isn’t over yet. If the situation and this defeat prompts a new combat  
objective, give it a rank and envision how you focus on this new goal.

```
You are aiding the evacuation of a research facility that is overrun
by aggressive, mutated creatures. You have two objectives: cover
the evacuation and secure the research data. But you find
yourself cut off from the labs, unable to press forward against
a tide of beasts. You Face Defeat on the secure the research
data objective. You are now in a bad spot, and envision getting
surrounded in your moment of indecision. You’ll keep the cover
the evacuation objective and add a new one: escape the horde.
```

If you Face Defeat and the fight continues, you are in a bad spot. If you are  
working together with allies, the nature of the defeat should help decide  
who is put in a bad spot. If a single character was working toward an  
objective independently and must Face Defeat, they are in a bad spot. If  
multiple allies were trying to achieve the same objective, each of them is  
in a bad spot.

196 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### Battle

```
When you fight a battle and it happens in a blur, envision your
objective and roll. If you primarily...
✴ Fight at range, or using your speed and the environment to your
advantage: Roll +edge.
✴ Fight depending on your courage, leadership, or companions:
Roll +heart.
✴ Fight in close to overpower your foe: Roll +iron.
✴ Fight using trickery to befuddle your foe: Roll +shadow.
✴ Fight using careful tactics to outsmart your foe: Roll +wits.
On a strong hit, you achieve your objective unconditionally. You and
any allies who joined the battle may take +2 momentum.
On a weak hit, you achieve your objective, but not without cost. Pay
the Price.
On a miss, you are defeated or the objective is lost. Pay the Price.
```

Make this move as an alternative to a detailed combat scene. If your story  
doesn’t emphasize fighting, or you’d rather abstract combat encounters,  
you can use this move exclusively. Or you can drop it into some portion of  
a larger scene. Perhaps you Battle to deal with lesser foes, then Enter the  
Fray for your main objective. The mix of Battle and detailed fight scenes  
can guide your focus to what is interesting or important.

```
Sentry bots attack as you approach the enemy outpost. You don’t
want to focus on this fight, so you Battle to see what happens.
```

A strong hit is unconditional success. You achieve your objective and your  
foes are defeated, surrender, or flee as appropriate to their nature and  
your intent. A weak hit means you achieve your objective, but at some  
cost. Since this is the resolution of an extended scene, the price you pay  
on a weak hit should be meaningful.

If you score a miss as you Battle, you fail to achieve your objective and  
must Pay the Price. Make it hurt, but not in such a way that it puts an end  
to your story. Envision what happens, apply the cost of this failure, and  
decide how you move forward.

When you and your allies Battle together, one of you takes the lead and  
makes the move. On a strong hit, everyone benefits from the narrative  
success, but only the character making the move takes the momentum  
bonus. On a weak hit or miss, suffer an outcome that fits the situation,  
either to an individual or the group.

COMBAT MOVES 197

## SUFFER MOVESSUFFER MOVES

When you bear the brunt of a failed action or make a concession, the  
suffer moves help resolve the cost. These moves are typically made  
when you must Pay the Price and face a hardship that directly impacts  
your well-being and readiness, or as prompted by a move or asset.

When you are delayed or disadvantaged...

```
Sacrifice Resources (page 205)
When you lose or consume resources...
```

```
Withstand Damage (page 206)
When your vehicle faces a damaging situation or environment...
```

The suffer moves are tied to a mechanical result, reducing the value of  
an associated resource (momentum, health, spirit, supply, a companion’s  
health, or a vehicle’s integrity) by an amount appropriate to the severity  
of the incident or nature of a foe. But when you apply the mechanical  
cost of a suffer move, don’t just move numbers around. Take a moment to  
envision the details in the fiction. How does the situation change? What  
happens next?

Also, keep in mind that a suffer move is only one way to represent a costly  
outcome. Introducing complications and perils without an immediate  
mechanical cost will amp up the tension and danger of your story. Bring  
down the hammer with a suffer move to represent compounding failures,  
or when you want to quickly resolve a cost without giving it undue focus  
in your story.

198 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### Lose Momentum

```
When you are delayed or disadvantaged, suffer -1 momentum for a
minor setback, -2 for a serious setback, or -3 for a major setback.
When your momentum is at its minimum (-6) and you must suffer
-momentum, choose one.
✴ Envision how the price is paid and apply the cost to a different
suffer move.
✴ Envision how this undermines your progress on a vow, expedition,
connection, or combat. Then, clear 1 unit of progress on that
track per its rank: troublesome=3 boxes; dangerous=2 boxes;
formidable=1 box; extreme=2 ticks; epic=1 tick.
```

Your momentum meter (page 35) tracks your character’s overall  
inertia, luck, and confidence, and will ebb and flow through a session.  
Make this move when you must Pay the Price and face a situational  
delay or disadvantage. Also, moves and assets will prompt you to Lose  
Momentum as a cost or concession, and may indicate a specific amount  
to suffer, phrased as “Lose Momentum (-X).”

When you make this move, reduce your momentum meter according to  
the nature of the setback: minor (-1), serious (-2), or major (-3). If the cost  
is open to interpretation, consider the scope of the situation. A minor  
setback is a slight inconvenience, while a major setback is a dramatic  
delay or hindrance. If in doubt, make it serious.

```
You are riding your SKIFF across storm-tossed seas. When you
must Pay the Price, you envision a large wave swamping your
vehicle. The SKIFF nearly keels over, and your gear is soaked. You
Lose Momentum as you struggle to get back on course.
```

Not every new problem should result in a loss of momentum. A  
complication or danger is often a great enough cost by itself, and doesn’t  
need mechanical impact to affect your character and story. Use the  
Lose Momentum move for meaningful but short-lived setbacks. Bigger  
misfortunes can stand on their own.

When you suffer a loss of momentum while your momentum meter is at its  
lowest point (-6), the leftover -momentum must be traded for an equal cost  
through another suffer move. Or it must be accounted for as lost progress  
in a progress track, using the vow, connection, expedition, or fight that is  
most relevant to the current situation. Make a choice between those two  
options as appropriate to the situation, and envision how this setback is  
reflected in the fiction.

SUFFER MOVES 199

### Endure Harm

```
When you face physical injury, fatigue, or illness, suffer -1 health for
minor harm, -2 for serious harm, or -3 for major harm. If your health is
0, Lose Momentum equal to any remaining harm.
Then, if your health is 0 or you choose to resist the harm, roll +health
or +iron, whichever is higher.
On a strong hit, choose one.
✴ Shake it off: If you are not wounded, take +1 health
✴ Embrace the pain: Take +1 momentum
On a weak hit, if you are not wounded, you may Lose Momentum (-1)
in exchange for +1 health. Otherwise, press on.
On a miss, it’s worse than you thought. Suffer an additional -1 health or
Lose Momentum (-2). If your health is 0, you must also mark wounded
or permanently harmed, or roll on the table below.
```

```
1–10 You suffer mortal harm. Face Death.
11–20 You are dying. Within an hour or two, you must Heal and
raise your health above 0, or Face Death.
21–35You are unconscious and out of action. If left alone, you
come back to your senses in an hour or two. If you are
vulnerable to ongoing harm, Face Death.
36–50You are reeling. If you engage in any vigorous activity
before taking a breather, roll on this table again (before
resolving the other move).
51–100You are still standing.
```

Make this move when you bear the brunt of a physical attack or impact, are  
exposed to harmful environments, are stricken with disease or sickness,  
or face a wearying undertaking.

When you must Pay the Price, you can Endure Harm if physical harm is  
a fitting outcome of the current situation. Also, moves and assets can  
prompt you to Endure Harm as a cost or concession, and may indicate a  
specific amount of stress to suffer, phrased as “Endure Harm (-X).”

```
You Face Danger to help extinguish a shipboard fire, and roll a
weak hit. You’ve succeeded, but must face a troublesome cost. You
envision the heat and smoke wearing you down, and Endure Harm.
```

200 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

When you Endure Harm, first, reduce your health meter by the amount  
of harm suffered: minor (-1), serious (-2), or major (-3). If the cost is open to  
interpretation, consider the severity of the situation or nature of your foe.  
For example:

```
✴ Minor (-1 health): Unarmed brawl; taking hits from a simple weapon;
bumps and bruises; lesser creature attack; tiring effort; mild sickness;
exposure to an unhealthy environment.
✴ Serious (-2 health): Powerful unarmed assault; forceful impact; small
arms fire; deadly creature attack; draining effort; lingering sickness;
exposure to a toxic environment.
✴ Major (-3 health): Heavy weaponry; mighty creature attack; stunning
injury; exhausting effort; exposure to a deadly environment.
```

If in doubt, make it serious.

If your health is reduced to 0, or was already at 0, you must Lose Momentum  
and apply any remaining -health to your momentum meter. For example,  
if you were at 1 health and suffer major harm (-3), reduce your health to 0  
and apply the remaining -2 to momentum.

Next, you’ll make a choice: Do you attempt to resist this harm and make an  
action roll, or suffer the cost and move on? If you are at 0 health, you have  
no choice—you must make the roll.

If you do make the roll, resolve the outcome as detailed. On a strong hit,  
you are undaunted; take +1 health (if you do not have the wounded impact)  
or +1 momentum. If you are in a fight, this strong hit puts you in control.

On a weak hit, you can choose to trade -1 momentum for +1 health as you  
roll with the punches. Otherwise, take the harm and press on.

On a miss, you must suffer an additional -1 health or Lose Momentum  
(-2). When you score a miss and your health is now at 0, you also need to  
make an important decision. Do you risk the potential of a dire outcome  
by rolling on the table, or do you suffer an impact? The wounded impact  
(page 50) is temporary and can be dealt when you successfully Heal.  
But becoming permanently harmed (page 52) is an enduring, life-  
changing event.

If you score a miss with 0 health and those impacts are already marked,  
you have no choice. Roll on the table to determine your fate.

**When you mark wounded, you cannot regain health until you successfully When you mark wounded, you cannot regain health until you successfully**

**HealHeal and clear that impact. and clear that impact.**

SUFFER MOVES 201

### Endure Stress

```
When you face mental strain, shock, or despair, suffer -1 spirit for
minor stress, -2 for serious stress, or -3 for major stress. If your spirit
is 0, Lose Momentum equal to any remaining stress
Then, if your spirit is 0 or you choose to resist the stress, roll +spirit or
+heart, whichever is higher.
On a strong hit, choose one.
✴ Shake it off: If you are not shaken, take +1 spirit
✴ Embrace the darkness: Take +1 momentum
On a weak hit, if you are not shaken, you may Lose Momentum (-1) in
exchange for +1 spirit. Otherwise, press on.
On a miss, it’s worse than you thought. Suffer an additional -1 spirit or
Lose Momentum (-2). If your spirit is 0, you must also mark shaken or
traumatized, or roll on the table below.
```

```
1–10 You are overwhelmed. Face Desolation.
11–25 You give up. Forsake Your Vow.
26–50You give in to fear or compulsion, and act against your
better instincts.
51–100You persevere.
```

Make this move when the unnerving perils of the Forge get the best of  
you, when you are discouraged or disheartened, or when you act against  
your best intentions.

When you must Pay the Price, you can Endure Stress if mental hardship  
is a fitting outcome of the current situation. Also, moves and assets can  
prompt you to Endure Stress as a cost or concession, and may indicate a  
specific amount of stress to suffer, phrased as “Endure Stress (-X).”

```
While traveling across the glassy lava fields of a furnace world in
your EXOSUIT, you are attacked by a massive creature with a rock-
like hide and powerful, grasping limbs. As the fight turns against
you, the beast grapples your EXOSUIT, dragging you to the ground.
You React Under Fire to push it away, but roll a miss. You envision
internal alarms blaring as the suit buckles under the pressure. The
slavering jaws of the creature are only inches from your face. This
seems like an appropriate moment to Endure Stress.
```

202 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

When you Endure Stress, first, reduce your spirit meter by the amount of  
stress suffered: minor (-1), serious (-2), or major (-3). If the cost is open to  
interpretation, consider the severity of the situation or nature of your foe.  
For example:

```
✴ Minor (-1 spirit): Doldrums or melancholy; unsettling incident;
frustrating failure.
✴ Serious (-2 spirit): Loneliness or heartache; shocking incident;
demoralizing failure; stinging remorse.
✴ Major (-3 spirit): Heart-rending despair; horrifying incident; dreadful
failure; profound guilt.
```

If in doubt, make it serious.

If your spirit is reduced to 0, or was already at 0, you must Lose Momentum  
and apply any remaining -spirit to your momentum meter. For example, if  
you were at 1 spirit and suffer major stress (-3), reduce your spirit to 0 and  
apply the remaining -2 to momentum.

Next, you’ll make a choice: Do you attempt to resist this stress and make  
an action roll, or suffer the cost and move on? If you are at 0 spirit, you  
have no choice—you must make the roll.

If you do make the roll, resolve the outcome as detailed. On a strong hit,  
you are unfazed; take +1 spirit (if you do not have the shaken impact) or +1  
momentum. If you are in a fight, this strong hit puts you in control.

On a weak hit, you can choose to trade -1 momentum for +1 spirit as you  
take a moment to steady yourself. Otherwise, take the stress and press on.

On a miss, you must suffer an additional -1 spirit or Lose Momentum (-2).  
When you score a miss and your spirit is now at 0, you also need to make  
an important decision. Do you risk the potential of a dire outcome by  
rolling on the table, or do you suffer an impact? The shaken impact (page  
50 ) is temporary and can be dealt when you successfully Hearten. But  
becoming traumatized (page 52) is an enduring, life-changing event.

If you score a miss with 0 spirit and those impacts are already marked,  
you have no choice. Roll on the table to determine your fate.

**When you mark shaken, you cannot regain spirit until you successfully When you mark shaken, you cannot regain spirit until you successfully**

**HeartenHearten and clear that impact. and clear that impact.**

SUFFER MOVES 203

### Companion Takes a Hit

```
When your companion faces physical hardship, they suffer -1 health
for minor harm, -2 for serious harm, or -3 for major harm. If your
companion’s health is 0, Lose Momentum equal to any remaining harm.
Then, if their health is 0 or you choose to test their resilience, roll
+your companion’s health.
On a strong hit, your companion rallies. Give them +1 health.
On a weak hit, if your companion’s health is not 0, you may Lose
Momentum (-1) and give them +1 health. Otherwise, they press on.
On a miss, it’s worse than you thought. They suffer an additional -1
health or you Lose Momentum (-2). If your companion’s health is 0,
they are out of action until given aid. If their health is 0 and you rolled
a miss with a match on this move, they are dead or destroyed; discard
the asset.
```

A companion (page 57) is a category of assets—a creature, robot, or  
other helper—that supports you on your adventures. When a companion  
is exposed to physical hardship, make this move.

When you must Pay the Price, you can make the Companion Takes a  
Hit move if harm to your companion is a fitting outcome of the current  
situation. Also, moves and assets can prompt you to make this move as a  
cost or concession, and may indicate a specific amount of harm to apply,  
phrased as “Companion Takes a Hit (-X).”

Companion asset cards have a health meter. When you make this move,  
reduce your companion’s health by the amount of harm suffered: minor  
(-1), serious (-2), or major (-3). See the Endure Harm summary (page 201)  
for examples of harm levels. If in doubt, make it serious.

If your companion’s health is reduced to 0, or was already at 0, you must  
Lose Momentum and apply any remaining -health to your momentum  
meter. For example, if they were at 1 health and suffer major harm (-3),  
reduce the integrity to 0 and apply the remaining -2 to momentum.

As with Endure Harm, you can make an action roll to resist the hit, or can  
choose to suffer the cost and move on. If your companion’s health is 0,  
you must make the roll.

When your companion’s health is at 0 and you score a miss, they are out  
of action. You cannot leverage their support until they gain at least +1  
health. Envision what this means in the fiction of your scene.

To give aid to a companion, make an appropriate move. Unless the asset  
describes otherwise, this is typically Heal for people and creatures, and  
Repair for mechanical companions.

204 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### Sacrifice Resources

```
When you lose or consume resources, suffer -1 supply for a minor
loss, -2 for a serious loss, or -3 for a major loss.
If your supply is exhausted (reduced to 0), mark unprepared. When
you suffer a loss of resources while unprepared, envision how this
causes you hardship and apply the cost to a different suffer move.
```

Your supply meter (page 48) is an abstract representation of your  
overall readiness, shared between you and your allies. Make this move  
to reduce supply when you deplete provisions, lose equipment, expend  
munitions, use up fuel or energy, squander funds, give up cargo as a  
trade or concession, or otherwise suffer an impact on your preparedness.

When you must Pay the Price, you can Sacrifice Resources if a hit to your  
readiness is a fitting outcome of the current situation. Also, moves and  
assets can prompt you to Sacrifice Resources as a cost or concession, and  
may indicate a specific loss to apply, phrased as “Sacrifice Resources (-X).”

If the cost is open to interpretation, consider the situation and reduce  
your supply meter as appropriate to the severity: minor (-1), serious  
(-2), or major (-3). A minor loss might be using up provisions while  
traveling or using extra ammo in a firefight. A serious loss is sacrificing  
valuable equipment or making a costly bribe. A major loss is suffering a  
catastrophic fuel leak or jettisoning cargo to appease pirates. If in doubt,  
make it serious.

```
You need info on the comings and goings at a large starport, and
attempt to Make a Connection with a local official. Unfortunately,
you roll a weak hit and must introduce a complication or cost to
begin the relationship. You envision paying a substantial bribe to
get their cooperation, and Sacrifice Resources.
```

If you are playing with allies, supply is shared. You track the rise and fall of  
your supply meter together. When anyone makes this move, each of you  
adjust your supply meter to that new value.

When your supply is reduced to 0, mark unprepared (page 50). While  
you are unprepared, you cannot increase your supply meter. This impact  
can be cleared when you successfully Resupply.

A lack of supply can affect your fitness, morale, and ability to take on  
challenges. If you suffer additional -supply while unprepared, you must  
apply an equal cost through another suffer move. For example, your ship  
might Withstand Damage as energy reserves run low, or you Endure  
Stress as the hardships of the Forge take their toll.

SUFFER MOVES 205

### Withstand Damage

```
When your vehicle faces a damaging situation or environment,
suffer -1 integrity for minor damage, -2 for serious damage, or -3 for
major damage. If your integrity is 0, Lose Momentum equal to any
remaining damage.
Then, if your integrity is 0 or you choose to resist the damage, roll +integrity.
On a strong hit, choose one.
✴ Bypass: If your vehicle is not battered, take +1 integrity
✴ Ride it out: Take +1 momentum
On a weak hit, if your vehicle is not battered, you may Lose Momentum
(-1) in exchange for +1 integrity. Otherwise, press on.
On a miss, it’s worse than you thought. Suffer an additional -1 integrity
or Lose Momentum (-2). If your integrity is 0, also suffer a cost
according to the vehicle type.
✴ Command vehicle: Mark the vehicle as battered or cursed, mark
a module as broken, destroy a broken module by discarding it,
or roll on the table below. If the command vehicle is destroyed,
Overcome Destruction.
✴ Support vehicle: Mark the vehicle as battered or roll on the table
below. If the vehicle is destroyed, discard the asset.
✴ Incidental vehicle: Roll on the table below.
```

```
1–10 Immediate catastrophic destruction. All aboard must
Endure Harm or Face Death, as appropriate.
11–25 Destruction is imminent and unavoidable. If you do not
have the means or intention to get clear, Endure Harm or
Face Death, as appropriate.
26–40Destruction is imminent, but can be averted if you Repair
your vehicle and raise its integrity above 0. If you fail, see
11–25.
41–55You cannot Repair this vehicle until you Resupply and
obtain a crucial replacement part. If you roll this result
again prior to that, see 11–25.
56–70The vehicle is crippled or out of your control. To get it back
in action, you must Repair and raise its integrity above 0.
71–85 It’s a rough ride. All aboard must make the Endure Harm,
Endure Stress, or Companion Takes a Hit move, suffering a
serious (-2) cost.
86–95You’ve lost fuel, energy, or cargo. Sacrifice Resources (-2).
96–100Against all odds, the vehicle holds together.
```

206 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

Make this move when your command vehicle, support vehicle, or  
incidental vehicle (page 65) suffers enemy fire, collisions, mechanical  
failures, hazardous environments, the crushing embrace of a giant space  
squid, or any other damaging situation.

When you must Pay the Price, you can Withstand Damage if damage to  
your vehicle is a fitting outcome of the current situation. Also, moves and  
assets can prompt you to Withstand Damage as a cost or concession,  
and may indicate a specific amount of damage to suffer, phrased as  
“Withstand Damage (-X).”

First, reduce the vehicle’s integrity meter by the amount of damage  
suffered: minor (-1), serious (-2), or major (-3). If the cost is open to  
interpretation, consider the severity of the situation or nature of your foe.  
For example:

```
✴ Minor (-1 integrity): Wear and tear; incidental hits and bumps
✴ Serious (-2 integrity): Weapons fire; collisions; hull or engine stress
✴ Major (-3 integrity): Powerful weapon hits; destructive impact;
explosions; hull breaches; systems failure
```

If in doubt, make it serious.

If your integrity is reduced to 0, or was already at 0, you must Lose  
Momentum and apply any remaining -integrity to your momentum meter.  
For example, if you were at 1 integrity and suffer major damage (-3), reduce  
the integrity to 0 and apply the remaining -2 to momentum.

Next, you’ll make a choice: Do you attempt to resist this damage and make  
an action roll, or suffer the cost and move on? If you are at 0 integrity, you  
have no choice—you must make the roll.

If you do make the roll, resolve the outcome as detailed. On a strong hit,  
your vehicle holds together; take +1 integrity (if your vehicle does not have  
the battered impact) or +1 momentum. If you are in a fight, this strong hit  
puts you in control.

On a weak hit, you can choose to trade -1 momentum for +1 integrity as  
you shunt power between systems or ease off the throttle. Otherwise,  
take the damage and press on.

On a miss, you must suffer an additional -1 integrity to the vehicle or Lose  
Momentum (-2). When you score a miss and your integrity is now at 0, you  
also need to choose an additional cost according to your vehicle type.

**When you mark a vehicle as battered, you cannot regain integrity until When you mark a vehicle as battered, you cannot regain integrity until**

**you successfully you successfully RepairRepair and spend repair points to clear that impact. and spend repair points to clear that impact.**

**When a module is marked as broken, you cannot benefit from its abilities When a module is marked as broken, you cannot benefit from its abilities**

SUFFER MOVES 207

## RECOVER MOVESRECOVER MOVES

Life as an Ironsworn is not easy or comfortable. When your resources are  
strained, your health and spirit ebbing, your equipment and vehicles in  
disrepair, you’ll need to find relief from the perils of the Forge and the  
burdens of your sworn oaths.

Make these recover moves when you attempt to rest, recover, or refit.

```
Sojourn (page 209)
When you spend time recovering within a community...
```

```
Heal (page 210)
When you receive medical care or provide treatment...

```
Hearten (page 211)

```
Resupply (page 212)
When you attempt to bolster your readiness...
```

```
Repair (page 214)
When you make repairs to your vehicles, modules, mechanical
companions, or other devices...
```

These moves are primarily focused on bolstering your character’s  
condition meters (page 47), including health, spirit, supply, and vehicle  
integrity. But the Heal move is also broadly useful for giving medical aid  
to allies and other characters, and the Repair move can be used for any  
machine or device.

208 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### Sojourn

```
When you spend time recovering within a community, roll +heart.
On a strong hit, this is a safe refuge. You and your allies may each
choose two recover moves: Heal, Hearten, Repair, or Resupply.
Instead of rolling, assume an automatic strong hit for each. An
individual move can be taken more than once.
On a weak hit, as above, but time is short or resources are strained.
You and your allies each make one recover move instead of two, with
no more than three moves total among the group.
On a miss, choose one.
✴ The community needs your help, or makes a costly demand in
exchange for safe harbor. Envision what they ask of you. If you
do it, or Swear an Iron Vow to see it done, resolve this move as
a strong hit.
✴ You find no relief, and the situation grows worse. Pay the Price.
```

Communities stand as an oasis within the perilous depths of the Forge.  
They range from tiny frontier outposts with a handful of residents,  
to spacefaring merchant caravans, to sprawling stations with many  
thousands of inhabitants. When you rest, refit, and share fellowship within  
a community that is willing and able to help you, make this move.

On a strong hit, you and your allies may each choose two recover moves.  
Instead of making an action roll for those moves, take an automatic strong  
hit. Envision this as socializing, bartering goods or data, spending funds,  
calling in favors, or simply asking for help. On a weak hit, you’ll take the  
same benefit for one recover move.

On a miss, you have a choice. If you accept the burden of a trouble or  
demand, resolve this move as if you rolled a strong hit. Otherwise,  
something prevents you from finding relief. Your background or nature  
alienates others. Resources are too scarce to share. A sudden, perilous  
event awaits you. Envision what happens and Pay the Price.

Sojourn requires hours or days, depending on your current circumstances  
and level of aid and recovery required. You can envision other interactions  
and perform additional moves during your layover. Sojourn is an  
overarching move that sets the tone for your visit and defines the ease of  
your recovery; it is not the only action you can take.

When you visit a community, you should envision what makes it unique,  
what challenges the people face, and what opportunities or dangers await  
you. If you need inspiration, Ask the Oracle.

Make this move only once when laying over within a community.

RECOVER MOVES 209

### Heal

```
When you receive medical care or provide treatment, envision the
situation and roll. If you...
✴ Receive treatment from someone (not an ally): Roll +iron
✴ Mend your own wounds: Roll +iron or +wits, whichever is lower
✴ Obtain treatment for a companion: Roll +heart
✴ Provide care: Roll +wits
On a strong hit, the care is helpful. If you (or the ally under your care)
are wounded, clear the impact and take or give +2 health. Otherwise,
take or give +3 health.
On a weak hit, as above, but the recovery costs extra time or resources.
Choose one: Lose Momentum (-2) or Sacrifice Resources (-2).
On a miss, the aid is ineffective and the situation worsens. Pay
the Price.
```

When you attempt to mend physical harm or sickness—for yourself, an  
ally, or an NPC—make this move. You’ll also make the Heal move if you or  
a biological companion are given medical aid by an NPC. The result of the  
move determines the scope and cost of the recovery.

```
During a planetside expedition, you suffer from exposure to toxic
spores and Endure Harm. Your health is now precipitously low, so
you find a spot to rest, break out your medkit, and roll +iron (the
lower of your iron and wits) to see how you fare.
```

Medical technology in the Forge is not magic. Healing takes effort and  
time—a few minutes for a quick treatment to get someone on their feet,  
and hours or days for more severe injuries. Envision as appropriate to the  
circumstances. If you face extended downtime, consider the impact on  
your quests.

On a strong hit, the care is effective. If the patient (you or an ally) has the  
wounded impact, you may clear it. A weak hit offers the same benefits,  
but also causes a delay or consumes resources.

A miss can mean you’ve caused or suffered harm, the patient’s condition  
introduces new complications, or a perilous event interrupts the care.

NPCs who are not companions do not have a health meter. When you  
attempt to give them medical aid, make this move and apply the result  
through the fiction. They will improve, or not, as defined by the move’s  
outcome. If you are tending to a robot companion or other machine, you  
should instead use the Repair move.

210 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### Hearten

```
When you socialize, share intimacy, or find a moment of peace,
roll +heart.
On a strong hit, you find companionship or comfort and your spirit is
strengthened. If you are shaken, clear the impact and take +1 spirit.
Otherwise, take +2 spirit. If you make this move as you Sojourn, take
+1 more.
On a weak hit, as above, but this indulgence is fleeting. Envision an
interruption, complication, or inner conflict. Then, Lose Momentum (-1).
On a miss, you take no comfort and the situation worsens. Pay
the Price.
```

When isolation, stress, fear, regret, heartache, and misfortune have taken  
their toll, make this move to renew your mental energy and fortitude.

First, envision the opportunity to Hearten. This might mean spending  
meaningful time with a connection or ally, seeking opportunities to  
socialize or indulge within a community, finding solitary comfort through  
prayer or meditation, or gaining inspiration through natural wonders.

On a strong hit, you gain spirit. If you have the shaken impact, you may  
clear it. On a weak hit, you recover, but this interlude is bittersweet and  
introduces new complications or emotional unrest. Envision what happens  
and Lose Momentum to represent this setback.

```
The bar at Paxton Depot is a popular watering hole for spacers in
the sector, so you stop by to swap stories, pick up the latest rumors,
and cheer yourself up with a few drinks. You roll to Hearten, and
score a weak hit. You take the boost to your spirit, but envision the
ill-timed entrance of a local merchant you once conned.
```

On a miss, your attempt to find comfort is undone by a dramatic event,  
emotional conflict, lingering trauma, or dire realization.

If you Hearten by building your relationship with an ally, such as sharing  
something of yourself or providing mutual emotional support, one or  
both of you may make the move and roll the dice. If the results are wildly  
divergent (such as a strong hit for one and a miss for the other), consider  
how the two of you come away from this time together with a different  
understanding or reaction. If an ally is instead focusing on providing  
emotional support for another member of the team, they can make the  
Aid Your Ally move to bolster that character’s attempt to Hearten.

### Resupply

```
When you attempt to bolster your readiness, envision the
opportunity and your approach. If you...
✴ Barter or make an appeal: Roll +heart
✴ Threaten or seize: Roll +iron
✴ Steal or swindle: Roll +shadow
✴ Scavenge or craft: Roll +wits
On a strong hit, choose one.
✴ If you are unprepared, clear the impact and take +1 supply.
Otherwise, take +2 supply.
✴ If you are in need of a specific item or resource that can reasonably
be obtained, you acquire it. Take +1 momentum.
On a weak hit, as above, but you must first deal with a cost,
complication, or demand. Envision the nature of this obstacle.
On a miss, you encounter an unexpected peril. Pay the Price.
```

This move covers various opportunities to bolster your readiness,  
including bartering with merchants, obtaining funds, scavenging wrecks  
and ruins, crafting or repurposing equipment, and pillaging cargo.  
Resources are scarce in the Forge, so you should ensure you have the  
opportunity and means to Resupply before making the move. If in doubt,  
Ask the Oracle.

```
While exploring a derelict ship, you locate a cargo bay and search
for worthwhile goods. Resupply +wits to see what you find.
```

First, pick the stat that best represents the situation and your approach,  
and make the action roll. A strong hit gives you a choice between bolstering  
your general supply or acquiring a specific, helpful item or resource. Take  
the option that best fits your needs and intent.

A weak offers the same benefit, but an obstacle stands in your way.  
Envision the concession you must make or danger you must overcome to  
obtain the resources.

On a miss, you take no benefit and things get worse. You attract unwanted  
attention, uncover an unexpected threat, are swindled by an underhanded  
merchant, or waste valuable time.

If you’re adventuring with allies, you share the same supply value. When  
one of you makes this move and gains supply, each of you make the same  
adjustment to your supply meter

212 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

Visiting a community is the most reliable means of bolstering your supply  
or obtaining unusual or valuable items. Large communities may have  
bustling markets where merchants peddle a variety of goods (lawful or  
otherwise), but even smaller outposts are often willing to lend support to  
a visiting spacer.

Currencies and customs vary wildly among the settlements of the Forge,  
so bartering is the norm. When you Resupply within a community, envision  
what you seek and what you offer in trade. Data such as navigation charts  
and planetary scans are a valuable commodity; trailblazing spacers often  
visit dealers with a cache of data ready to exchange for food, fuel, ammo,  
and other necessities.

RECOVER MOVES 213

### Repair

```
When you make repairs to your vehicles, modules, mechanical
companions, or other devices, envision the situation and roll. If you...
✴ Make your own repairs, or direct a companion to make repairs:
Roll +wits
✴ Obtain repairs from someone (not an ally): Roll +supply
On a hit, you gain repair points as appropriate to the situation, per the
table below. Additionally, you may Sacrifice Resources and exchange
each -1 of supply for 1 extra repair point (up to 3 points).
```

```
Situation Strong Hit Weak Hit
At a facility 5 points 3 points
In the field 3 points 1 points
Under fire 2 points 0 points
```

```
Spend repair points as follows. Unused points are discarded.
✴ Clear the battered impact on a vehicle: 2 points
✴ Fix one broken module: 2 points
✴ Take +1 integrity on a vehicle: 1 point
✴ Take +1 health for a mechanical companion: 1 point
✴ Repair any other device: 3 points
✴ Repair any other device, but with a complication or malfunction:
2 points
On a miss, the repairs are not made and the situation worsens. Pay
the Price.
```

The life of a spacer is a dangerous one, and sometimes the machines  
you rely on bear the brunt of those perils. When your vehicles, modules,  
robotic companions, or other devices need mending, make this move.

If you’re making your own repairs, or if you assign the task to a companion,  
roll +wits. If you are instead relying on the skill and good graces of  
another character—such as a shipwright at a planetside docking bay,  
or a mechanic in some remote outpost—roll +supply. Making this move  
+supply represents using goods, funds, or materials to subsidize the work  
of a skilled NPC.

```
One of your connections is a tinkerer living alone amid the blasted
wastes of a desert world. When your COMBAT BOT companion
suffers severe damage in a firefight, you visit the tinkerer and roll
to Repair +supply to see what can be done.
```

214 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

When you Repair and score a hit, you gain repair points. This is a limited  
resource used only within the scope of the move to prioritize and make  
repairs. The amount of repair points you earn varies according to the  
situation and the outcome of the move, per the included table. Here’s a  
summary of those situations:

```
✴ At a facility: You have access to a well-equipped location suited to
conducting repairs, such as a settlement dockyard or repair shop.
✴ In the field: You are on your own in the depths of space, on a remote
planet, or in a community that lacks equipment and infrastructure.
✴ Under fire: You are in the midst of a crisis, such as in combat,
navigating a hazardous environment, under extreme time pressure,
or dealing with life-and-death mechanical failures.
```

If you’re unsure whether a particular location has the infrastructure  
needed to count as a “facility,” Ask the Oracle. But feel free to give it the  
benefit of the doubt. Even the most far-flung settlements often have the  
skills and resources to keep their machines running.

If you roll a hit and want to bolster your available repair points, you can  
Sacrifice Resources and trade supply for repair points, one for one.

Then, use the list of costs in the Repair move to allocate repair points  
to specific tasks, including clearing vehicle impacts, raising vehicle  
integrity, fixing broken modules, and bolstering the health of mechanical  
companions. If you are playing with allies, repair points can be applied to  
their assets if it’s reasonable under the circumstances.

The “repair any other device” options are used to deal with narrative  
complications for equipment, machines, and components. For example,  
you might deal with a faulty shipboard gravity generator, fix a broken  
weapon, or aid a settlement by repairing their water processor. If you  
spend 3 repair points, it is fully repaired. If you spend only 2 points,  
envision a lingering issue for the device that may cause future trouble.

```
Your environment suit malfunctions while exploring a planet with
a toxic atmosphere. Running out of air, you hastily Repair and
roll +wits. You score a strong hit, which gives 2 repair points for
being “under fire.” That’s enough to get the air flowing again, but
you envision a faulty battery that leaves your headlamp flickering
ominously. It is nighttime, and the darkness closes in...
```

If you roll a miss, the repairs are ineffective, and things get worse. Perhaps  
you are interrupted by a greater peril, unintentionally cause more damage,  
or are fleeced by a fraudulent mechanic.

Repair might require seconds, minutes, hours, or days as appropriate to  
the situation and the scope of the damage. Unused repair points cannot  
be saved for future use.

## THRESHOLD MOVESTHRESHOLD MOVES

Despite your best efforts to overcome the perils of the Forge, calamitous  
events may bring you to the precipice of life and death, redemption and  
desolation, perseverance and destruction.

In these moments you face your greatest tests. What will become of you  
when all seems lost? Will you see your character undone, or find yourself  
on a path of renewed purpose? Make these threshold moves to find out.

```
Face Death (page 217)
When you encounter a situation where death is an immediate and
unavoidable outcome, or when you are brought to the brink of death
with a chance for recovery or redemption...

When you are brought to the brink of desolation...
```

```
Overcome Destruction (page 220)

These moves are (hopefully) rarely made. They are an opportunity to  
upend your character’s adventures, reinforce the perils of the Forge, and  
deepen your story. When you make a threshold move, give it a focus.  
Make it dramatic and personal.

216 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### Face Death

```
When you encounter a situation where death is an immediate
and unavoidable outcome, you are dead. When you are instead
brought to the brink of death with a chance for recovery or
redemption, roll +heart.
On a strong hit, you are cast back into the mortal world.
On a weak hit, choose one.
✴ You die, but not before making a noble sacrifice. Envision your
final moments.
✴ There is more to be done. Envision what is revealed or asked of you
at death’s door, and Swear an Iron Vow to complete an extreme
quest. You return to the mortal world and must mark doomed.
When you complete the death-bound quest, clear the impact.
On a miss, you are dead.
```

Make this move when prompted by another move such as Endure Harm or  
Withstand Damage, or when you face a physical trauma so dire that death  
(or a strong chance of death) is the most likely and dramatic outcome.

If the current situation means certain death for your character, make this  
move as an automatic miss. You are dead. If there is a chance to return  
from the brink, you should instead make an action roll.

On a strong hit, you are alive. Consider what happens next. How did you  
survive? Do you return to consciousness minutes, hours, or even days  
later? Or was this the briefest glimpse of an averted fate?

```
You take a hit in a gunfight, fail to Endure Harm with your health
at 0, and trigger the Face Death move. You envision slumping
behind cover, one hand clutching your injury. Your heartbeat fades.
Blackness fills your vision. You make the roll. A strong hit! A moment
later, adrenaline surges and you are gasping for breath...
```

On a weak hit, make a choice: Is this a final, heroic sacrifice, or are you  
driven to accept a quest at the boundary of life and death? If you take the  
quest, envision how the nature of the vow is revealed through a personal  
epiphany or strange visitation. Then, Swear an Iron Vow and mark the  
doomed impact (page 52). This impact can only be cleared if you  
successfully Fulfill Your Vow on the quest.

On a miss, you are dead. This is the end of your character’s story, but not  
their legacy. You can Continue a Legacy to learn the mark they made upon  
the Forge and their influence on your new character.

THRESHOLD MOVES 217

### Face Desolation

```
When you are brought to the brink of desolation, roll +heart.
On a strong hit, you resist and press on.
On a weak hit, choose one.
✴ Your spirit breaks, but not before you make a noble sacrifice.
Envision your final moments.
✴ You see a vision of a dreaded event coming to pass. Envision
that dark future, and Swear an Iron Vow to prevent it through
an extreme quest. You return to your senses and must mark
tormented. When you complete the soul-bound quest, clear
the impact.
On a miss, you succumb to despair or horror and are lost.
```

Make this move when prompted by another move such as Endure Stress.  
You are at the breaking point for your character. Do you push on in spite  
of all you have experienced, all you have done, or do you surrender to  
hopelessness or darkness? Roll to find out.

```
You are on an expedition deep in the bowels of a precursor vault.
When you Undertake an Expedition and roll a miss, you envision
yourself lost in the vast labyrinthine passages. You hear the
whirring and humming of ancient mechanical guardians closing in
around you. It is too much to bear. You Endure Stress, reduce your
spirit to 0, roll a miss, and trigger the Face Desolation move. The
next roll will decide your fate...
```

On a strong hit, you come to your senses or find renewed hope.

On a weak hit, you must make a choice. Will you make a final, heroic stand  
before leaving your life as Ironsworn behind? Or will you find meaning in  
a soul-bound quest? If you take the quest, envision a prophetic and fearful  
dream or vision. Then, Swear an Iron Vow and mark the tormented impact  
(page 52). This impact can only be cleared if you successfully Fulfill  
Your Vow to see the dreaded future undone.

On a miss, you are broken. Your time as Ironsworn is done.

If this is the end of your character’s story, you can Continue a Legacy to  
carry on with a new character in the same setting.

218 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### Overcome Destruction

```
Progress Move
When your command vehicle is destroyed or irrevocably lost,
you must discard the asset, along with any modules and docked
support vehicles.
If you survive, you may use your connections to replace some of
what was lost. To learn the cost, roll the challenge dice and compare
to the progress on your bonds legacy track.
On a strong hit, you may call in a favor. This comes without conditions.
On a weak hit, you owe someone. You must mark indebted and
Swear an Iron Vow to complete an extreme quest in their service.
When you complete the duty-bound quest, clear the impact.
On a miss, as with the weak hit result, but this quest is against your
nature, forces you to Forsake Your Vow on another quest, or is in the
service of an enemy.
If you accept the cost, take 1 experience for every marked ability on
the discarded assets (minimum 3 experience). Spend this experience
only on a new command vehicle, modules, and support vehicles.
```

Make this move when your command vehicle (page 55) is demolished,  
damaged beyond repair, or irrevocably lost. You may be prompted  
to Overcome Destruction when you Withstand Damage and fail, or in  
response to a dramatic narrative circumstance that makes the loss of  
your command vehicle inescapable.

First, discard the command vehicle asset along with any modules and  
docked support vehicles. Then, envision how you survive and what you  
do next. If you are stranded on a remote planet, drifting through space in  
an escape pod, or captured by an enemy, finding your way back to your  
life as an independent spacer can be an adventure of its own.

When you are in a position to reach out to your connections, you may make  
a progress roll against your bonds legacy track. Your progress score is the  
number of filled boxes on that track. Only add fully filled boxes (those with  
four ticks). Then, roll your challenge dice, compare to your progress score,  
and resolve a strong hit, weak hit, or miss. You may not burn momentum  
on this roll, and you are not affected by negative momentum.

The result determines the narrative cost as you lean on the support of your  
connections. Envision who you reach out to, and the cost you must bear,  
as appropriate to the result of your progress roll. This may mean that you  
(the player) are ahead of your character’s understanding of what happens  
next. Pull some narrative strings to put your character in touch with (or on a  
collision course with) a connection that fits the move’s outcome.

220 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

A strong hit as you Overcome Destruction finds you in the good graces of a  
connection who owes you a favor. Envision who among your connections  
offers help.

A weak hit forces you to take on a quest as repayment. Envision the nature  
of this quest as appropriate to the connection’s role and goals. You must  
mark the indebted impact (page 52) to represent the burden of this  
obligation, and cannot clear the impact until you successfully Fulfill Your  
Vow on that quest.

On a miss, you must accept a quest and mark indebted to gain the help  
of a connection. In addition, the vow fundamentally undermines your  
own objectives or nature. To regain what was lost, what promises will you  
break? What vows will you forsake? What ideals will you sacrifice?

```
Following the disastrous loss of your STARSHIP and a fraught
escape from the hold of a pirate ship, you find your way back
to populated space. What will a fresh start cost? You make the
Overcome Destruction progress roll to find out. Unfortunately, you
score a miss. You envision receiving a communication from one of
your less reputable connections, a notorious weapons dealer. They
offer to serve as your patron and fund a new ship, but only if you
swear to transport a cache of deadly weapons into the heart of a
warring sector.
```

If you move forward under those conditions, take the experience as  
defined by the move, and Advance to spend it. This experience is not tied  
to your legacy tracks and can only be spent to purchase and upgrade a  
new command vehicle, modules, and support vehicles. If you are holding  
this experience in reserve until you are in a position to obtain those assets  
through the course of your story, make note of it.

If you score a weak hit or miss and don’t accept the quest and the indebted  
impact, you don’t gain the consolation experience. You must instead use  
experience accrued through your legacy tracks to replace what was lost.

If you are playing with allies, one of you represents the group to make the  
Overcome Destruction progress roll. You can envision this as reaching out  
to a unique connection or shared connection. If you must mark indebted,  
decide if that impact is tied to a single character (likely the one making  
the move), or the group. If everyone is affected by this liability, you should  
each mark the impact.

## LEGACY MOVES

The three legacy tracks—quests, bonds, and discoveries—are a special  
type of progress track to show the evolution of your character. As you  
fulfill vows, build relationships, and explore the Forge, you’ll mark  
progress on these tracks and gain experience. This experience is then  
spent on character assets to represent your character’s growing skills,  
influence, and resources.

Make these legacy moves to gain and spend experience, and when you  
face a final test to learn how your accomplishments and failures will echo  
through time.

222 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### Earn Experience

```
When you fill a box (four ticks) on any legacy track, take 2
experience. This experience may be spent when you Advance.
Once you completely fill the tenth box on any legacy track, clear that
track. You may start again marking progress on the cleared track, but
earn experience at a reduced rate of 1 experience (instead of 2) for
each filled progress box. If you make a progress roll against this track,
resolve the outcome as if at 10 progress.
```

Legacy tracks (page 44) are a special type of progress track that  
represent the challenges you’ve overcome, along with the resources,  
influence, reputation, and skills you can bring to bear.

You have three legacy tracks: quests, bonds, and discoveries. As you  
complete quests, form bonds, and explore the Forge, you advance along  
these tracks by marking ticks and filling boxes. Some asset abilities may  
also prompt you to mark progress on a specific legacy track, or increase  
the rewards for marking progress.

Each time you fill a box completely (four ticks) on any legacy track, you  
make this move and gain 2 experience. That experience can then be spent  
on new assets or asset upgrades when you Advance. See page 45 for  
details on managing unspent experience using your legacy tracks.

As noted in the move text, you begin earning reduced experience  
on a legacy track once you completely fill that track. In the fiction, this  
represents the natural diminishing returns of character experience and  
expertise. From a gameplay perspective, it helps keep your abilities to a  
manageable number. If you reach a point where your character’s ambitions  
and obligations are waning, Continue a Legacy to end their story.

224 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### Advance

```
When you develop your abilities, improve your resources, gain a
reward, or boost your influence, you may spend 3 experience to add
a new asset, or 2 experience to upgrade an asset. Choose from the
following categories as appropriate to your focus and opportunities.
✴ Module: Upgrade your command vehicle
✴ Support Vehicle: Acquire or improve a secondary vehicle
✴ Path: Bolster your personal capabilities or follow a new calling
✴ Companion: Gain or improve a trusted helper
✴ Deed: Learn from your experiences or build a legacy
```

Make this move when you spend experience to add an asset or upgrade  
an existing asset. See page 45 for details on how to record spent  
experience using your legacy tracks.

When you Advance, you should consider how your recent experiences,  
successes, and projects have led to your new resources and abilities.  
You can bend the fiction of your story toward an asset you would like to  
purchase or upgrade, or let your selection of assets flow naturally from the  
situations and opportunities you encounter.

For example:

```
✴ You barter some precursor artifacts to pay for a REINFORCED HULL.
✴ You charted paths into the far reaches of the Forge, making you a
skilled NAVIGATOR.
✴ A grateful connection, a skilled shipwright, presents you with a custom
SNUB FIGHTER as a gift.
✴ You steal an armored EXOSUIT from a band of mercenaries.
✴ In your downtime, you work to overhaul a deactivated SURVEY BOT.
✴ You betray a powerful faction and are now a FUGITIVE.
```

Envisioning how your abilities connect to experiences gives them  
additional significance and context. They will be a reminder of the paths  
taken, the challenges overcome, and the bonds formed.

Keep in mind that assets are only part of your character. They help define  
the major aspects of your role, resources, and abilities, but don’t limit what  
you can gain or accomplish in the course of your story.

```
You rescue a stray GLOWCAT from a ruined settlement, but don’t
have experience to spend on the companion asset. Your new
friend still exists in your story, but doesn’t have narrative focus or
mechanical benefits until you Advance and acquire the asset.
```

LEGACY MOVES 225

### Continue a Legacy

```
Progress Move
When you retire from your life as Ironsworn, or succumb to death
or desolation, you may create a new character in your established
setting. If you do, roll the challenge dice and compare to each of the
former character’s legacy tracks: quests, bonds, and discoveries (one
roll per track).
For each strong hit, choose one from below, or one from the weak
hit or miss options.
✴ Follow their path: Take one path or companion asset from the
former character (at no cost), including any marked abilities.
✴ Share a connection: Take one connection from the former
character, including any accrued progress or bond benefits.
✴ Accept an inheritance: Take the former character’s command
vehicle and one module or support vehicle (at no cost), including
any marked abilities.
For each weak hit, choose one from below, or one from the miss
options.
✴ See it through: Choose one of the former character’s unfinished
quests, and Swear an Iron Vow (with an automatic strong hit) to
see it done. You may immediately mark up to half their earned
progress (round down) on this quest.
✴ Rebuild a connection: Name one of the former character’s
connections, and envision how time or circumstances have
changed them in a dramatic way. When you Make a Connection
with them, take an automatic strong hit and mark two ticks on
your bonds legacy track.
✴ Explore familiar ground: Name a location that was meaningful to
the former character. When you first visit that place, envision how
it has changed or is endangered. Then, mark two ticks on your
discoveries legacy track.
For each miss, choose one.
✴ Deal with the aftermath: Envision how one of your former
character’s foes has gained power or influence.
✴ Switch loyalties: Envision how you begin in opposition to your
former character’s beliefs, goals, or allegiances.
✴ Open Pandora’s Box: Envision how an advancement or discovery
has unleashed unexpectedly dire consequences.
```

226 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

How have you left your mark upon the Forge? What do you leave for those  
who follow in your footsteps? If your character chooses to leave the path  
of the Ironsworn or suffers a premature end through death or desolation,  
make this move to discover their legacy.

First, make a separate progress roll against each of your legacy  
tracks: quests, bonds, and discoveries. Tally the progress score for  
each track by counting the number of filled boxes. Only add fully  
filled boxes (those with four ticks). You may not burn momentum on these  
rolls, and you are not affected by negative momentum.

Once you resolve the number of strong hits, weak hits, and misses among  
the three rolls, choose your options from the move. You can pick any  
outcome at or below your level of success, but cannot choose a specific  
result more than once.

If you are playing with allies, and everyone is making this move at once, the  
number of results can be a bit overwhelming. You may instead divide  
the progress rolls among players so that you are only choosing three  
results in total—one for each legacy track. If your character is the only one  
who retired or succumbed, make the move as normal; then, work with the  
other players to bring your new character into the story.

LEGACY MOVES 227

## FATE MOVESFATE MOVES

In solo and co-op play, the fate moves mediate the result of other moves or  
serve as inspirational prompts for your story. When you face the uncertain  
outcome of a move, want to know what happens next, or have a question  
about people, places, and events, these moves help reveal the answer.

```
Ask the Oracle (page 229)
When you seek to resolve questions, reveal details, discover
locations, determine how other characters respond, or trigger
encounters or events...
```

```
Pay the Price (page 232)
When you suffer the outcome of an action...
```

The fate moves combine your storytelling instincts with a dash of  
unpredictability to help resolve questions and situations. This includes  
three main techniques:

```
✴ Instinct: If an answer to a question or the result of a situation is
obvious, interesting, and dramatic, make it happen.
✴ Randomness: Roll on random tables to answer a specific question or
to generate the details of a story element such as a person, creature,
or location.
✴ Inspiration: Use abstract creative prompts to help guide your story.
Creative interpretation will lead you naturally from an abstract concept
to a relevant answer.
```

In guided mode, the guide represents the whims of fate. They can  
reference the fate moves and oracles as they like, but can also decide the  
outcome or direct questions back to the players.

228 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### Ask the Oracle

```
When you seek to resolve questions, discover details, reveal
locations, determine how other characters respond, or trigger
encounters or events, you may...
✴ Draw a conclusion: Decide the answer based on the most
interesting and obvious result.
✴ Spark an idea: Use an oracle table or other random prompt.
✴ Ask a yes/no question: Decide the odds of a yes, and roll on the
table below to check the answer.
✴ Pick two: Envision two options. Rate one as likely, and roll on the
table below to see if it is true. If not, it is the other.
```

```
Odds The answer is yes if you roll...
Small Chance 10 or less
Unlikely 25 or less
50/50 50 or less
Likely 75 or less
Almost Certain 90 or less
```

```
On a match, envision an extreme result or twist.
```

In solo or co-op play, use this move when you have a question about the  
outcome of an action, an aspect of your setting, or a narrative event. In  
guided play, the guide can Ask the Oracle to gain inspiration or respond  
to player questions.

**DRAW A CONCLUSION**

The most basic use of this move—and a fundamental approach when you  
are filling the gaps of your story or world—is to simply decide the answer.  
Think it over for a moment (or talk it out), and go with what seems most  
appropriate or introduces the most potential for drama and excitement.

```
You face a peril on the surface of a furnace world. What do you
encounter? Since you already established that this planet is fraught
with ash storms, you envision dark clouds gathering...
```

Your first instinct is often the right one. If it leapt to mind, it’s probably a  
good fit for the current situation. But if your initial impulse doesn’t excite or  
interest you, give it more thought. Wait for an “aha” moment.

If you’re still not sure of the answer, or want to put it in the hands of fate,  
you have some other options. See the next page for details.

FATE MOVES 229

#### SPARK AN IDEA

The next option is to ask a question and use an oracle table or other  
random generator to reveal the answer.

See Chapter 5 (page 288) for an array of oracle tables suited to playing  
Starforged. This includes generators for locations, people, creatures, and  
starships, along with abstract oracles that you interpret as appropriate to  
your question and the current situation.

```
You roll a weak hit as you attempt to Compel an informant to give
up the location of a fugitive. Per the move, your contact makes
a demand or counteroffer. What do they want? You roll on the
Action and Theme oracle tables for inspiration. The oracle answers
“Preserve Life.” You envision the contact revealing a personal
connection to the fugitive, and asking for a promise that you’ll bring
them in unharmed
```

You can also use your own preferred tools to help spark ideas, such as  
online generators for character names, or tarot cards for visual inspiration.

**ASK A YES/NO QUESTION**

You can ask a binary yes/no question and leave the answer open to fate.

Decide the likeliness of a yes answer, and roll your oracle dice to get the  
result. For example, if you rate the chance of a yes as unlikely, you must  
roll 25 or less for a yes. Otherwise, the answer is no.

```
You reach an orbital station at the end of a long expedition, but the
outpost is unresponsive. You envision making a close flyby in your
ship, and Ask the Oracle, “are there any signs of damage?” You set
the odds to 50/50.
```

#### PICK TWO

The final option is to ask a question as a choice between two viable results.

Rate one of your choices as likely, and roll on the table. If it’s a yes, the  
likely pick is your answer. If not, it’s the other. Use this approach when the  
question is more open-ended than a simple yes/no, but you have a couple  
of alternatives in mind.

```
You are ambushed on the outskirts of planetside settlement. But
by whom? You’ve had run-ins with both the local authorities and a
band of territorial scavengers, so you Ask the Oracle to reveal the
answer. You set the scavengers as the likely culprit.
```

230 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

#### ROLLING A MATCH

A match on your oracle dice when rolling on the yes/no table should  
trigger an extreme result or narrative surprise. This can mean an all-caps  
“HELL YES!” or “HELL NO!” or a yes or no but with an interesting twist or  
dramatic complication.

When you’re unsure what a match might mean, you can roll on another  
oracle table for inspiration. If you’re still left scratching your head, just  
move on. Resolving a match is never a requirement. It’s just a way to  
introduce narrative turning points that lead you along unexpected paths.  
Head down the rabbit hole, but don’t get stuck in it.

**QUESTIONS UPON QUESTIONS**

You can come back to the yes/no table and ask a follow-up question to  
clarify or affirm a result. However, don’t let one question snowball into a  
series of more specific questions. Even when playing solo, oracles should  
be the spice of your game, not the main course. Ask a question or two,  
decide what it means, and move on. When in doubt, follow your gut. Your  
first instinct is probably the right one. Go with it.

**ORACLES AND GUIDED PLAY**

In guided play, the guide is the oracle. When the players pose a question  
or a situation creates uncertainty, the guide can simply decide an answer,  
Ask the Oracle for inspiration, or turn the question back to the players.

FATE MOVES 231

### Pay the Price

```
When you suffer the outcome of an action, choose one.
✴ Make the most obvious negative outcome happen.
✴ Ask the Oracle for inspiration. Interpret the answer as a hardship
or complication appropriate to the situation.
✴ Roll on the table below. If the result doesn’t fit the situation,
roll again.
```

```
1–2 A trusted individual or community acts against you
3–4 An individual or community you care about is exposed
to danger
5–7 You encounter signs of a looming threat
8–10 You create an opportunity for an enemy
11–14 You face a tough choice
15–18 You face the consequences of an earlier choice
19–22A surprising development complicates your quest
23–26You are separated from something or someone
27–32Your action causes collateral damage or has an
unintended effect
33–38Something of value is lost or destroyed
39–44The environment or terrain introduces a new hazard
45–50A new enemy is revealed
51–56A friend, companion, or ally is in harm’s way (or you
are, if alone)
57–62Your equipment or vehicle malfunctions
63–68Your vehicle suffers damage
69–74You waste resources
75–81 You are harmed
82–88You are stressed
89–95You are delayed or put at a disadvantage
96–100Roll twice
```

Make this move when prompted by another move due to a negative  
outcome, or when the current situation naturally leads to a cost through  
your choices or actions.

First, choose an option as described in the move. You may decide the  
outcome yourself, Ask the Oracle for insight, or roll on the included table.  
In guided play, look to your guide for a ruling. Whatever choice you make,  
always follow the fiction. If an appropriate and dramatic outcome springs  
to mind, go with it.

232 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

#### RESOLVING THE COST

Once you’ve identified the basics of the negative outcome, envision it in  
more detail. What happens? How does it change the current situation and  
your approach going forward? Focusing on the fiction as you Pay the Price  
will lead to deeper, more dramatic stories.

In fact, Pay the Price can often impact the narrative without an immediate  
mechanical cost. An initial failure may lead to a complication or force  
a reactive move. A failure on a subsequent move can then introduce  
a mechanical penalty. In this way, failures build on each other, and the  
situation gets riskier and more intense.

Similarly, narrative costs that reveal major complications and dramatic  
surprises don’t need mechanical reinforcement. The twists and turns of  
your story are often enough of a price to pay.

That said, mechanical costs help spotlight the taxing perils of the Forge,  
give focus to your character’s status and readiness, and serve as a price to  
pay when you don’t want to introduce snowballing narrative complications.  
If there is a mechanical cost, consider its impact.

```
✴ If you suffer a delay or momentary setback, Lose Momentum.
✴ If you face a physical hardship or injury, Endure Harm.
✴ If you are disheartened or frightened, Endure Stress.
✴ If you deplete supplies or lose preparedness, Sacrifice Resources.
✴ If your vehicle takes a hit, Withstand Damage.
✴ If an ally or companion is put in harm’s way, apply the cost to them.
```

```
You suffer a cost during an interstellar journey, and roll on the Pay
the Price table to learn that “you face a tough choice.” You envision
a fierce energy storm blocking your path. You could go through it,
and risk damage to your ship, or go around and delay your arrival
at the next waypoint by several hours. You choose the safer course,
and Lose Momentum.
```

The narrative and mechanical costs you endure—and the focus you give  
to them—should fit the circumstances and the move you are making.  
Scoring a miss as you Battle implies a more dramatic cost than if you fail  
to Clash within a more detailed fight scene. For dramatic moments and  
decisive moves, up the stakes.

**WHAT’S NEXT?**

Once you Pay the Price and resolve the immediate cost, envision what  
happens next and how you react. You are not in control. The situation is  
more complex and dangerous. You may need to respond with another  
move to restore your advantage and avoid further cost.

FATE MOVES 233

## CLOCKSCLOCKS

In Starforged, you are the center of your universe. Moves and progress  
tracks are primarily managed from your perspective. Other people, beings,  
and threats do not have mechanical weight, and their narrative influence  
is focused on how they aid or hinder your own objectives.

But time is an unyielding force. Powers and factions are busy pursuing  
their own agendas. You are only one small part of a complex galaxy.

If you want to forge a more dynamic and reactive universe, clocks might be  
the answer. These optional devices track the evolution of forces external  
to your character or the rising tension of an imminent danger. They are  
usually used to measure the progression of something bad happening,  
but can also gauge the headway of a friendly force or faction toward a  
project or goal.

By default, clocks are represented by circles divided into four, six, eight,  
or ten segments.

When a clock advances, fill in a segment. Start at the 12 o’clock position,  
and move clockwise around the circle as you fill segments. When the  
clock is full, whatever problem or event it was tracking comes to fruition.

Never erase segments—clocks are inexorable and only move forward. If  
a clock is no longer a factor due to your actions or because of external  
events, the clock stops and is removed from play.

There are two main types of clocks: campaign clocks (see next page), and  
tension clocks (page 238). In addition, this section includes guidelines  
for scene challenges (page 239), which are a structured method of  
resolving tension clocks.

**Printable clocks are available as part of the Printable clocks are available as part of the StarforgedStarforged PlaykitPlaykit. But you. But you**

**can manage clocks in whatever form is convenient. For example, draw can manage clocks in whatever form is convenient. For example, draw**

234 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### Campaign Clocks

The Forge does not stand still. As you undertake your sworn vows and  
delve the depths of the galaxy, other people, factions, and threats evolve  
and advance their own agendas.

To depict and resolve the objectives and actions of these entities in the  
background of your campaign, use campaign clocks.

Campaign clocks represent aspects of the setting that can be positive,  
negative, or neutral from your character’s perspective. Your character  
might be unaware of the factors powering a clock as it ticks away behind  
the scenes, or it can represent a looming danger or opportunity.

Here are some examples of situations and projects using campaign clocks:

```
✴ An unstable star builds toward a supernova. When the clock is full,
nearby planets and settlements face cataclysmic destruction.
✴ A powerful faction is building a new waystation on the frontier of
settled space. When the clock is full, the outpost is open for business.
✴ A far-reaching computer virus infects computers throughout a sector.
When the clock is full, the virus compromises a key data hub.
✴ A mercenary company conducts a violent offensive to seize a key
mining facility. When the clock is full, they take control.
✴ Researchers work to develop a technology for matter teleportation.
When the clock is full, this new tech is deployed.
✴ A band of scrappy rebels fight to overthrow a tyrannical faction. When
the clock is full, that faction is destroyed or driven out of the sector.
✴ A cult gathers artifacts that will usher in a return of ancient and
malevolent beings. When the clock is full, the portal is opened.
```

Jump to the next page for details on managing campaign clocks.

CLOCKS 235

#### SETTING A CAMPAIGN CLOCK

Give the clock a name that makes it clear what project is complete or event  
triggered when the clock is filled. Then, decide the number of segments  
as appropriate to the complexity and duration of the activities leading to  
that ultimate outcome.

It’s not an exact science, but you can equate segments of a clock to the  
number of gameplay sessions or chapters before it triggers, plus or minus  
two. For example, a clock with six segments will probably trigger in four to  
eight sessions—unless something stops it.

**ADVANCING A CAMPAIGN CLOCK**

When you Begin a Session, make a check against any active campaign  
clocks. If advancing a clock is not in doubt—enough time has passed or the  
pieces are in place to make it inevitable—simply fill in the next segment.  
If circumstances or time conspire to push the clock forward more rapidly,  
fill two segments.

If there are factors or forces that create uncertainty, you can Ask the  
Oracle using the yes/no table, which is shown below.

```
Odds The answer is yes if you roll...
Small Chance 10 or less
Unlikely 25 or less
50/50 50 or less
Likely 75 or less
Almost Certain 90 or less
```

To make the check, Ask the Oracle, “does the clock advance?” Set the  
outcome to likely as your default, and adjust up or down one row if other  
factors or forces (including your own aid or interference) have a strong  
influence on the clock. If it is more likely, make it almost certain. If it is  
less likely, make it 50/50. In exceptional circumstances, you can push the  
chance as low as unlikely.

See the next page for details on resolving the question.

```
Northstar Syndicate, a ruthless trade guild, is
waging a campaign to take control of facilities,
exchanges, and charted passages in a key sector.
Through bribes, threats, and force, they’ll attempt
to squeeze out or eliminate other trade operations.
You create a campaign clock with six segments to
track their progress.
```

236 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

```
If the answer is yes, fill a clock segment. If you also roll a match
on your oracle dice, envision how this situation or project gains
dramatic support or inertia, and fill two segments instead of one.
If the answer is no, do not fill a segment. The situation or project
has stalled for now, or encountered resistance. If you also roll a
match on your oracle dice, envision a surprising turn of events that
pits new factors or forces against the clock.
```

You can also make checks for your campaign clocks in the midst of a  
session when significant time passes, or when circumstances in your  
narrative push a clock forward.

**COMPLETING A CAMPAIGN CLOCK**

Once the clock is filled, the event is triggered or the project is complete.  
Envision the outcome and the impact on your setting. If your character  
becomes aware of a crisis or opportunity triggered by the clock, it might  
be the catalyst for a new quest.

**STOPPING A CAMPAIGN CLOCK**

If events in your campaign bring a definitive end to a situation or project  
tracked by a clock, that clock is removed from play.

**RIVAL CAMPAIGN CLOCKS**

If two powers or factions are pursuing opposing goals, give each a clock  
to track both sides of the conflict. When you Ask the Oracle if those clocks  
advance, consider their relative strength and approaches as you set the  
likelihood for each. Then, envision the actions and outcome as appropriate  
to whether both, neither, or only one of the clocks advance.

When one of the rival clocks is completely filled, that power or faction  
achieves its goal, and the other fails or is defeated. Both clocks are then  
removed from play.

**Guides can use campaign clocks to manage off-screen events and faction Guides can use campaign clocks to manage off-screen events and faction**

**activities. Some clocks can be made visible to the players, while others activities. Some clocks can be made visible to the players, while others**

**are used to advance situations they don’t have knowledge of (yet). are used to advance situations they don’t have knowledge of (yet).**

```
When you Begin a Session, you check on the
status of Northstar Syndicate’s campaign. You
Ask the Oracle if the campaign clock advances,
making it likely, and roll a yes with a match. That’s
two segments of the clock filled for this phase. You
envision Northstar paying off local pirates to step
up attacks against other operations.
```

CLOCKS 237

### Tension Clocks

```
Use a tension clock to represent a looming threat or deadline in a scene,
or an escalating danger that persists across scenes. Unlike campaign
clocks, tension clocks do not advance independent of your actions. They
are smaller-scope clocks that fill as you suffer setbacks or fail to act.
Here are a few examples of tension clocks in action:
✴ You are retreating from a fight, but the enemy has called in
reinforcements. You create a tension clock that fills as you are pinned
down or delayed. When the clock is full, reinforcements arrive and
block your way out.
✴ You are infected with a parasite that feeds on your adrenaline. You
create a tension clock that fills as you face stressful situations. When
the clock is full, the parasite reaches the next stage of its life cycle.
✴ You are escorting a cargo ship through enemy space. You create a
tension clock to represent progressive damage to that ship. The clock
advances as you fail to defend against attackers or lead the ship into
hazardous environments. When the clock is full, the ship is disabled.
✴ You are in a battle near an unstable reactor. You create a tension clock
that fills as the reactor takes hits from errant gunfire. When the clock
is full, an explosion is imminent.
```

```
SETTING A TENSION CLOCK
To create a tension clock, name it and decide the number of segments.
If the danger or deadline is imminent, make it four or six segments. If it
represents a longer-term threat, make it eight or ten segments.
```

```
ADVANCING A TENSION CLOCK
As you Pay the Price or encounter a complication in a situation where a
tension clock is active, you can resolve the cost or concession by filling a
segment on the clock. The looming threat or deadline is getting closer. If
it is a dramatic failure, such as a miss with a match, make it two segments.
```

```
COMPLETING A TENSION CLOCK
Once the clock is filled, the threat or deadline triggers. This should result in
harrowing problems for your character. It may even force you to abandon
an expedition, fight, vow, or other challenge.
```

```
STOPPING A TENSION CLOCK
If you escape the looming threat or deadline, or it is no longer relevant,
stop the clock and remove it from play.
```

238 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### Scene Challenges

A scene challenge is an optional structured approach for resolving  
an extended non-combat scene against a threat or other characters,  
particularly when a time limit or looming danger adds extra urgency.  
Examples of a scene challenge include disarming a timed explosive,  
hacking a system while evading digital countermeasures, participating in  
a formal debate, or competing in a hoverbike race.

To start a scene challenge, make the Begin the Scene move. As part of this  
move, you’ll create a standard progress track (troublesome, dangerous,  
or formidable) to measure your headway towards an objective. You’ll also  
set a tension clock of four segments to represent the gains made by your  
opponents or the advancement of a looming threat or deadline.

```
BEGIN THE SCENE
When you face an extended or complex challenge , name your objective
and choose a rank as appropriate to the situation.
✴ You have a clear advantage: Troublesome
✴ You are ready to act: Dangerous
✴ You are unprepared or outmatched: Formidable
Then, activate a 4-segment tension clock and Face Danger or Secure an
Advantage to take action.
```

When choosing the rank of the objective, consider the scope of the  
situation and your level of readiness. If unsure, make it dangerous.

**MAKING YOUR MOVES**

Once the scene is underway, Face Danger or Secure an Advantage to  
take action. Scene challenges use a variation of these moves (detailed on  
the next page) to resolve your actions.

The choice between the two moves is a narrative and mechanical  
decision. Face Danger is reactive, used to avoid threats or overcome  
obstacles. Secure an Advantage is proactive for when you are using  
resources, abilities, or expertise to prepare or gain leverage. But there  
will be situations where either move is valid. In that case, consider your  
intended result. Face Danger is focused on building progress and pushing  
the scene to a conclusion, while Secure an Advantage builds momentum  
and extends the scene. Face Danger is riskier, since a weak hit means  
dialing up the tension by filling a clock segment.

Even if you take an action that would trigger another move, resolve that  
action using these versions of Face Danger or Secure an Advantage. For  
example, if you are participating in a debate, do not make the Compel  
move to convince the audience of your argument. Instead, Face Danger or  
Secure an Advantage with a stat appropriate to your approach.

CLOCKS 239

```
FACE DANGER (SCENE CHALLENGE)
When you attempt something risky or react to an imminent threat
within a scene challenge, envision your action and roll. If you act...
✴ With speed, mobility, or agility: Roll +edge
✴ With resolve, command, or sociability: Roll +heart
✴ With strength, endurance, or aggression: Roll +iron
✴ With deception, stealth, or trickery: Roll +shadow
✴ With expertise, focus, or observation: Roll +wits
On a strong hit, you are successful and mark progress. On a strong hit
with a match, mark progress twice.
On a weak hit, you are successful and mark progress, but also encounter
a complication or setback. Envision what occurs and fill a clock segment.
On a miss, you fail, or a momentary success is undermined by a dramatic
turn of events. Fill a clock segment and Pay the Price. On a miss with a
match, fill two segments and Pay the Price
```

```
SECURE AN ADVANTAGE (SCENE CHALLENGE)
When you assess a situation, make preparations, or attempt to gain
leverage within a scene challenge, envision your action and roll. If
you act...
✴ With speed, mobility, or agility: Roll +edge
✴ With resolve, command, or sociability: Roll +heart
✴ With strength, endurance, or aggression: Roll +iron
✴ With deception, stealth, or trickery: Roll +shadow
✴ With expertise, focus, or observation: Roll +wits
On a hit, you are successful. On a strong hit, take both. On a strong hit
with a match, take both and mark progress. On a weak hit, choose one.
✴ Take +2 momentum
✴ Add +1 on your next move (not a progress move)
On a miss, you fail or your assumptions betray you. Fill a clock segment
and Pay the Price. On a miss with a match, fill two segments and Pay
the Price.
```

#### WORKING WITH ALLIES

The scene challenge progress track and tension clock are shared with  
your allies. Guided by the fiction, move the focus among the characters.  
Any allies involved in the scene can make the Face Danger or Secure an  
Advantage move. Any character can also Aid Your Ally to contribute to a  
move another character is about to make.

240 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

#### ENDING THE SCENE CHALLENGE

Continue to Face Danger and Secure an Advantage as appropriate to  
your approach. Apply the outcome of each move to the current situation  
and envision how you take action or what happens next.

When the tension clock is filled, time is up. You must Finish the Scene  
by making a progress roll against your objective. You will also Finish  
the Scene when the progress track is filled, or if the narrative and your  
accumulated progress is guiding the challenge to a conclusion.

```
FINISH THE SCENE
Progress Move
When the scene challenge tension clock or progress track is filled, or
when events lead to the scene’s conclusion, roll the challenge dice and
compare to your progress.
On a strong hit, you achieve your objective unconditionally.
On a weak hit, you succeed, but not without cost. You must Pay the
Price. Make this a minor cost relative to the scope of the scene.
On a miss, you fail or are undermined by a dire turn of events.
Pay the Price.
```

#### MASS COMBAT USING A SCENE CHALLENGE

Scene challenges are intended for use in non-combat conflicts. But what  
if you find yourself in command of a large force of NPCs? You can use a  
scene challenge to resolve the clash of mighty armies and fleets.

When you Begin the Scene, envision the nature of the battle and consider  
the makeup of the opposing forces. Based on that starting situation, set  
the challenge rank.

```
✴ You have superior numbers, position, or firepower: Troublesome
✴ Neither side has a clear advantage: Dangerous
✴ You are facing a superior force or are badly positioned: Formidable
```

Then, envision your approach as you lead your force into battle. Face  
Danger or Secure an Advantage as appropriate, choosing a stat that  
represents the current situation and your tactics. Resolve the outcome of  
each move and mark the progress track and clock as normal.

During the battle, you and your allies may Enter the Fray to zoom in and  
give focus to a fight against an important foe or key objective. Use the  
combat moves to resolve your objective in that fight. If you are successful,  
mark progress on your scene challenge progress track. If you lose the  
fight, fill a segment on the tension clock.

When you Finish the Scene to end the battle, envision the extent of your  
victory or cost of your defeat.

CLOCKS 241

## CONFLICT BETWEEN ALLIES

Starforged mechanics and moves are not intended to provoke conflict  
among allies. Instead, the focus is on the drama and challenges of perilous  
quests in a mysterious galaxy. You and your allies will stand together  
against the forces that would see your vows unfulfilled. You are working  
toward shared—or at least complementary—goals.

That said, situations within the fiction may put you and an ally at odds. Your  
characters are not perfect. They may try to act rashly in a tense situation.  
They might stubbornly cling to a self-defeating approach or point of  
view. They might pursue their own vows at the cost of their relationships.  
Making non-optimal choices as your character, creating more trouble for  
yourself, is part of dramatic storytelling.

So how do you deal with the situation when allies clash?

**CONFLICT WITHOUT MOVES**

Disagreements between characters can usually be handled through  
roleplaying. Talk it out, as your characters. But take care to not let this  
fictional conflict carry over into the real world. If things get heated or  
uncomfortable, Take a Break. When you return to the game, discuss your  
approaches out-of-character, agree on next steps, and transition back into  
the fiction to resolve the situation from the perspective of your characters.

**CONFLICT USING MOVES**

If you want to resolve a conflict among allies through moves, make  
opposed Face Danger rolls to decide the outcome in a single exchange.

```
✴ Both describe what you are doing to persuade, act against, or resist
your ally, and Face Danger using an appropriate stat.
✴ If at least one of you scores a hit, determine who gains control of the
outcome by comparing your level of success: strong hit with a match
> strong hit > weak hit > miss > miss with a match. If you both have
the same level of success, use your action score (your action die +
stat + any adds) as a tie-breaker. If you are still tied, envision how your
actions lead to a complete stalemate.
✴ Whoever gains control of the outcome decides which of the two
moves should be resolved and works with the other player to depict
that result in the fiction. The result of the other move is ignored.
✴ If neither of you scored a hit, resolve the miss for both moves. Each of
you must Pay the Price.
```

Use this procedure sparingly for unusual circumstances, taking care to  
not take control of another player’s character. Work together to interpret  
the framing and outcome of the scene, with each of you describing your  
character’s intent and reaction.

242 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

Archer and Luna, stranded on the surface of a fungus-encrusted  
world, travel to a planetside industrial facility. They are in desperate  
need of help, but this remote outpost bears the markings of Clan  
Thorn, a powerful faction that is hunting for them both. Archer  
wants to give the facility a wide berth, but Luna is insistent on  
taking a closer look.

“Come on, let’s see what we can find,” Luna says. “We need to get  
off this toxic rock. They’ve probably got a spare shuttle lying about.”

“That’s your plan?” Archer says. “We’ve been dodging Clan Thorn  
for weeks and you want to go say hello?”

“We don’t have any other options. You think there’s another  
settlement just around the next mushroom?”

Archer is not convinced. “No way. It’s too risky.”

“We seem to be at an impasse,” Luna says. “Roll for it? I’ll Face  
Danger with iron to see if I can get your blood up.”

“Sure. I’ll Face Danger plus heart to reason with you.”

Archer rolls a weak hit and Luna scores a strong hit. Since Luna  
achieves a higher degree of success on her move, she gets to  
decide the outcome. She chooses to let her move stand. She is  
successful and takes +1 momentum.

“I stand tall, look you straight in the eyes, and tell you that this is  
our only option,” Luna says. “Besides, isn’t it about time we get a  
bit of payback? Show Clan Thorn that we’re done running? I don’t  
know about you, but I’m in the mood to give this hornet’s nest a  
good kick.”

“Okay, fine, but I’ve got a bad feeling about this,” Archer says.

Luna laughs, “You always do.”

## PRINCIPLES OF PLAYPRINCIPLES OF PLAY

These principles are your polestars for managing Starforged sessions.  
Start here, and find your path to awesome stories.

### Universal Principles

#### SWEAR IRON VOWS, AND SEE THEM FULFILLED OR FORSAKEN

Sworn vows are the foundation of your Starforged stories. You introduce  
an urgent problem or personal quest, Swear an Iron Vow to set things  
right, and play to see what happens. The ritualized aspect of swearing  
vows gives your quests narrative weight in the fiction of your setting,  
while the mechanical framework provides inertia and structure for your  
gameplay sessions.

**PORTRAY A PERILOUS BUT HOPEFUL FUTURE**

The Forge is a dangerous and mysterious place, full of threats known and  
unknown. Too often, the people of the galaxy fight and scheme amongst  
themselves instead of standing together against these greater perils.

Likewise, your character is competent, perhaps even heroic, but not  
perfect. You are flesh and blood. You will fail. You will get hurt. You will  
make mistakes. You will lose faith. You will act against your better instincts.  
Make decisions through the flawed but driven perspective of this person.

Despite those sometimes grim realities, there is hope. There is beauty  
and wonder to be found. Love and kinship to be preserved. Wrongs to put  
right. Look for opportunities to reveal the optimistic and inspiring aspects  
of your story and setting.

**BEGIN AND END WITH THE FICTION**

Set every scene and action within the fiction. What is happening? What  
are you doing? What does it look like? If a move is triggered, make it. Then,  
look to the fiction as you resolve the move and decide what happens next.  
Keep things moving forward, bookending the mechanics of your moves  
with the fiction.

Starforged rules, moves, and assets often use the term “envision.” This  
prompt is your reminder to visualize the scene or the action. Don’t rush  
through your moves with a focus on the mechanical outcomes. Let your  
story breathe. Go beyond the surface details. Ask questions (or Ask the  
Oracle), and build on the answers.

In co-op and guided modes, collaborate to create a shared understanding  
of the current situation. If something is unclear or at odds with the  
assumptions of another player, talk it out until everyone has a clear picture  
of the situation. When playing solo, take the time to imagine the scene and  
take note of important details.

244 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### Principles for Solo Play

#### CHRONICLE YOUR ADVENTURES

When you play Starforged with other players, the shared conversation  
helps create a story that lives beyond the game table. When playing solo,  
the conversation is between you and the system. The mechanics and  
moves are part of that conversation, but your character and your world  
exist only for you.

This can make your story feel a bit fleeting. To ground your sessions and  
make it easier to pick up where you left off, keep a record at whatever  
level of detail you prefer. This can be simple bullet points in a text file,  
a log in a virtual tabletop, a handwritten journal filled with sketches and  
notes, a play report you share on a forum or blog, or even a streamed or  
recorded session. There’s no wrong answer. Use whatever approach is an  
enjoyable aspect of your play. If it feels like work, simplify.

**ASK THE ORACLE, BUT TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS**

Oracles are a valuable tool for solo play, but don’t let them replace your  
own storytelling instincts. Too many oracle rolls can make a session feel  
like an exercise in randomness.

Trust your gut. If it’s dramatic, fits the fiction, and pushes your story  
forward, make it happen. When you want to gloss over something, do so.  
Use the oracles to fill in the gaps. Keep it moving.

**BE A FAN OF YOUR CHARACTER (STOP HITTING YOURSELF)**

Here’s something unexpected: Solo players are hard on their characters.  
While a guide will moderate the severity of outcomes to keep everyone  
motivated and having fun, solo players often default to severe results  
when they suffer a cost or complication, grinding their character down  
through mechanical and narrative penalties. What’s more, they’ll envision  
these setbacks as inherent failings of the character, instead of factors out  
of their control.

Perhaps this is born out of a desire not to “cheat.” But you are the ultimate  
arbiter of your story; it’s not possible to cheat. In fact, the Change Your  
Fate move offers explicit permission to alter, redo, or ignore any fictional  
or mechanical outcome that is unsafe or un-fun.

The gameplay of Starforged is tuned to introduce complications and  
adversity, so don’t be reluctant to give your character a break. Use the  
techniques described in the Pay the Price summary (pages 232 – 233 )  
to balance narrative and mechanical costs. Create a sense of rising  
tension by escalating the danger and risk of situation, instead of hitting  
your character hard out of the gate. Save the dire complications and major  
mechanical costs for key, dramatic moments. When it matters, make it  
hurt. Until then, give your character space to be awesome. They’ll thank  
you for it.

PRINCIPLES OF PLAY 245

### Principles for Cooperative Play

#### CRAFT A STORY THROUGH CONVERSATION

Roleplaying as a group is conversation. Use this conversation to build a  
shared imagining of your world. The deeper the conversation, the more  
opportunities you find to take your story in interesting new directions.

Ask questions of each other to help create a coherent, shared picture of  
what is happening in the fiction. Deepen your setting and your characters  
by adding evocative details. You’ll be surprised how often an offhand  
suggestion can snowball into exciting story possibilities.

**BUILD A UNIVERSE TOGETHER**

When playing without a guide, you each take part in filling that role—  
crafting elements of the setting, portraying other characters, introducing  
challenges, posing questions, and providing answers. The nature of  
Starforged mechanics and oracles means you can do this in the moment,  
without preparation, switching from the perspective of your character and  
back again. When something is uncertain or you want to leave it to the  
whims of fate, Ask the Oracle and work together to interpret the answer.

**SHARE THE SPOTLIGHT**

Be a generous, collaborative player. Within scenes, work to keep each  
character visible and each player engaged. Use the conversation to give  
everyone input into the narrative. Share opportunities to roll on oracle  
tables and interpret the results.

For your broader campaign, don’t let one character’s vow drive your story  
through every session. Mix it up. Give each character opportunities to  
explore their own motivations and quests, and find ways to give everyone  
a personal stake in your sworn vows.

246 CHAPTER 3: GAMEPLAY IN DEPTH

### Principles for the Guide

#### FACILITATE, DON’T IMPOSE

You are the guide for your players as they explore the setting and the  
story of their characters. You set the scenes and portray the creatures  
and characters they encounter. When the narrative hits a lull, or someone  
creates an opportunity for a complication, consequence, or discovery,  
make something happen.

But you are a guide with an unreliable compass heading into unknown  
realms. Let the players choose their path. Moderate the conversation  
without dominating it.

**DELIVER ANSWERS AND ASK QUESTIONS**

The players will look to you to answer questions about the setting, portray  
the actions and reactions of other characters, and help determine the  
outcome of moves. When they do, answer their question, keeping in mind  
the fiction and truths you’ve established through play.

You should also look for opportunities to motivate input from others at  
the table. Encourage them to add details and ground every move in the  
fiction. Work to create a shared world and narrative that everyone has  
stake in. Answer questions by asking questions. If a conversation hits a  
dead end or drags on, take the question back, deliver an answer (or Ask  
the Oracle), and move on.

**EMBRACE CHAOS**

Don’t over-prepare for your session. Feel free to come to the table with  
nothing planned. The character-driven quests help you and the other  
players build a story together. Anything that is not a protagonist or move  
has very little mechanical detail, and can be introduced on the fly.

Letting go of your plans leaves you open to the unexpected. Cheer for  
surprising successes. Seize the story possibilities of dramatic failures.  
Forge a galaxy of wonder and danger.

You can also use the oracles for answers and inspiration. Ask a yes/no  
question through the Ask the Oracle move, or interpret a response from  
the oracle tables. You can even collaborate with your players to interpret  
an oracle’s answer.

**Whether playing solo, cooperative, or with a guide, use the Whether playing solo, cooperative, or with a guide, use the StarforgedStarforged**

## FORGING NPCs

An NPC (non-player character/creature) is anyone who inhabits your  
campaign other than your character and those portrayed by your fellow  
players. They can be a person, being, or creature. As you play, you  
introduce and encounter NPCs that fit your version of the setting, enhance  
your story, and enrich your character’s adventures.

This chapter includes an array of sample NPCs (starting on page 258) as  
inspiration for foes and encounters in your story. But because NPCs don’t  
have mechanical detail and are represented almost entirely in the fiction  
of your story, you can envision and resolve your interactions with other  
people and lifeforms without advance preparation.

INTERACTING WITH NPCS

NPCs—as appropriate to their nature and intent—may ignore you, aid you,  
or oppose you. When your interactions with them involve uncertainty and  
risk, make appropriate moves to see what happens. Springboard off those  
moves with new details and complications to flesh out these characters.  
When you are unsure of their traits or next action, Ask the Oracle.

Reoccurring NPCs should have more detail and narrative weight. Give them  
personalities, unique looks, quirks, and motivations. Let them throw the  
occasional wrench in the works of your quests with a surprising revelation.  
Make a note of what you learn of them. If you Make a Connection with  
them, track your progress as you build that relationship.

GENERATING NPCs USING ORACLES

In Chapter 5 (page 288), you’ll find an extensive set of random tables,  
including generators to help populate your galaxy.

```
✴ Use the character oracles (page 330) to reveal aspects of a person,
including their disposition, role, traits, goals, and name.
✴ Use the creature oracles (page 336) to generate a creature’s form,
encountered behavior, and other aspects.
✴ Use the faction oracles (page 340) to introduce a group of NPCs as
a ruling power, guild, or fringe group.
```

Don’t try to build a fully formed understanding of a person, being, or  
creature when you first encounter them; instead, focus on what your  
character learns or perceives as a first impression. You can envision or  
generate additional details over time. See page 293 for details.

OTHER SOURCES OF INSPIRATION

Since you don’t need to worry about “building” NPCs under mechanical  
constraints, you can easily take inspiration from other games and media. Or  
pick and choose NPCs from the Ironsworn rulebook or Delve supplement,  
reimagining them to fit the spaceborne setting.

FORGING NPCS 253

## JOINING FORCES WITH NPCJOINING FORCES WITH NPCss

If your story leads you to cooperating with helper NPCs to overcome  
challenges, consider how they impact the fiction and your moves. Unless  
they are a companion asset (page 57) or connection (page 162), an  
NPC won’t give you mechanical bonuses on your actions. They also won’t  
make moves of their own. They are simply a part of your story, perhaps  
impacting the moves you make, the results of those moves, and the rank  
of your challenges.

For example:

```
✴ If a powerful NPC agrees to support you on a sworn quest by granting
a request or providing a key resource, you can Reach a Milestone and
mark progress on that vow.
✴ If you are fighting alongside NPCs, you can reduce the rank of your
objective in a fight (page 183). For example, battling alone to repel
a raider assault might be an extreme objective. If you are aided by a
stalwart band of settlers, you could shift the rank to formidable.
✴ If you are charged with protecting NPCs, they might be placed in
danger or suffer losses when you face a cost or concession. For
example, if you are attacked by pirates while protecting a fleet of
refugee ships on an interstellar journey, you might envision those
ships taking hits or being boarded.
✴ An NPC with specialized skills or resources might give you
opportunities to make or avoid specific moves. For example, if you
gain navigation charts for an interstellar passage from a helpful
navigator, you could Set a Course. This would allow you to resolve
the journey in a single zoomed-out move, instead of making it a more
complex, lengthy, and perilous expedition.
```

As with any NPC, you can Ask the Oracle to see how a helper NPC  
responds, how they fare in a challenge, or what they do next. If you are  
attempting to influence them in a risky or uncertain situation, make moves  
such as Compel to see what happens. If they will have a reoccurring role  
in your story, you can Make a Connection with them.

**NPCs—even if they are a connection—are independent characters. They NPCs—even if they are a connection—are independent characters. They**

**might accompany you on a specific mission, but they have their own might accompany you on a specific mission, but they have their own**

## CHAPTER 4: FOES AND ENCOUNTERS

## NPC NPC COMPONENTSCOMPONENTS

The NPCs in the following section include some broad details to help  
guide how they are represented in your story. You can also consider these  
elements when creating your own encounters.

CHALLENGE RANK

Sample NPCs have a single mechanical attribute, their rank, using the  
standard Starforged challenge hierarchy. These ranks are represented  
within the NPC descriptions as filled hexagons.

#### USING NPC RANKS

When does the rank matter? Here’s some examples:

```
✴ Use the rank as a gauge to help envision the relevant power and
influence of an NPC.
✴ Use the rank to set the level of focus you’d like this NPC to have in
your story. A troublesome NPC may have a brief and minor role. The
introduction of an epic NPC may have huge impact in your campaign.
✴ Use the rank to frame your interactions, and whether those interactions
are uncertain or risky. Talking your way past a troublesome guard
might be simple enough to avoid triggering a move. A formidable
guard is likely well-trained and cunning.
✴ Use the rank of an NPC when you Make a Connection with them. A
higher ranked NPC will require more effort and focus as you work
toward building a bond.
✴ When you Enter the Fray, use the rank of the foe as a factor when
setting the challenge rank of your objectives.
✴ When you face physical harm or stress at the hands of an NPC, take
their rank into account as you Endure Harm or Endure Stress. When
unsure, you can consider troublesome foes as typically inflicting 1
harm or stress, dangerous and formidable foes as inflicting 2 harm or
stress, and extreme or epic foes as inflicting 3 harm or stress. Adjust
as appropriate to the scale, armament and, methods of the character.
A truly titanic NPC is of an immeasurable rank in comparison to your
puny character.

256 CHAPTER 4: FOES AND ENCOUNTERS

#### FEATURES

Features are the typical outward characteristics of an NPC. They are not  
universally true, especially among diverse societies and lifeforms, but can  
provide some common impressions as a starting point.

DRIVES

Drives reflect the motivations and instincts of an NPC. For creatures,  
these are relatively simple: hunt, eat, defend territory. For intelligent  
beings, drives are their typical goals and beliefs, but do not represent  
the complex range of motivations you will encounter. Drives are a starting  
place, giving you the rough outline of a typical NPC to be fleshed out (or  
contradicted) appropriate to their role in the fiction.

TACTICS

Tactics provide a reference for how an NPC or an enemy vehicle might act  
in combat. These give you a sense of typical approaches and maneuvers,  
but do not represent the possibilities of a complex and dramatic combat  
scene. You should let NPC actions flow out of the fiction. What is the  
situation? What is their goal? What will add to the excitement and danger  
of this moment? Make it happen. When in doubt, Ask the Oracle.

Your foes should do more than simply try to inflict harm. A fearsome roar or  
demoralizing boast might cause you to Endure Stress. Tactical maneuvers  
reduce your momentum. Fictional complications— unexpected abilities or  
weapons, the appearance of new foes, environmental dangers, threats  
against companions or allies, realizations that undermine your quest—will  
heighten the drama of the scene.

The Combat Action oracle (page 383) can help inspire an action for a foe  
in a fight. Roll on this table and interpret the result as appropriate to the  
nature of the NPC or vehicle.

VARIANTS

Sample NPCs include one or more alternate forms, group identities,  
manned vehicles, or companions. These variants have their own  
challenge rank. You can also create your own variant of a sample NPC  
simply by envisioning their characteristics and adjusting the rank. For  
example, the cunning leader of a scrap bandit gang might be a formidable  
(instead of dangerous) foe.

QUEST STARTER

All NPCs include a quest starter that can serve as inspiration for a trouble  
in your setting and a sworn vow.

**The human NPCs in the following section can also offer inspiration for The human NPCs in the following section can also offer inspiration for**

**your own character’s background or role—perhaps a life they left behind.your own character’s background or role—perhaps a life they left behind.**

NPC COMPONENTS 257

## SAMPLE NPCSAMPLE NPCss

This section includes a variety of NPCs to help inspire some of the foes,  
forces, and creatures you may encounter in your adventures. Use what  
fits your version of the Forge, keeping in mind the choices you made  
when you defined the truths of the setting. If your campaign is gritty and  
grounded, ignore any fantastical NPCs. If you want to boost the strange  
aspects of the Forge, you can emphasize the supernatural or monstrous.

### Chiton

The chiton are not native to any single planet, and are adaptable to most  
environments. Some suggest they are an ancient precursor bioweapon  
seeded across the galaxy. The larva of the telepathic queen can lay  
dormant for thousands of years, emerging only when its sleep is disturbed  
by the mental energies of intelligent life. An awoken queen quickly  
metamorphoses into its adult form and lays its first clutch of eggs. Soon  
after, newly-hatched drones set out to expand the nest and feed their  
ravenous progenitor.

```
Quest Starter: At a remote facility, researchers are studying a newly-
discovered chiton queen larva. The immature queen is held in frozen
stasis, but something might have gone wrong. The return of a transport
ship ferrying supplies to the researchers is weeks overdue. What is your
connection to the facility or to the faction overseeing it?
```

**CHITON DRONE PACK** [[[]][[[]]

```
Chiton drones rarely operate independently. Instead, they hunt and
attack in packs under the telepathic control of their queen.
```

**CHITON QUEEN** [[[[][[[[]

```
The chiton queen is a massive creature with segmented pincers,
an armored carapace, and a bulging, egg-carrying abdomen. From
the depths of the nest, it commands its drones telepathically. This
psychic communication is so powerful it can even breach human
consciousness—troubling dreams and waking hallucinations might
be the harbinger of a chiton invasion.
```

```

### Colossus

The colossi are titanic humanoid machines created by a long-dead  
civilization. We do not know their original purpose. Perhaps they were  
weapons built for conquest in a ancient war, or mighty devices designed  
to explore new worlds.

Most colossi are found inactive—frozen in icy wastes, overgrown within  
verdant jungles, entombed in the depths of fathomless seas. Their  
armored shell is resistant to time and harsh environments, and they are  
nearly as imposing and majestic as the day they were forged.

Rarely, a colossus awakens to carry out its inscrutable purpose. They  
stride across the landscape of alien worlds, shaking the ground with  
each massive footfall. These active colossi ignore our attempts at  
communication and bat away our ineffectual attacks—the technology that  
powers them is beyond our understanding.

```
Quest Starter: A faction discovered a heavily damaged but dormant
colossus, gaining access for the first time to the internal systems of one
of these great machines. The researchers believe it can be controlled by
a human through a neural connection, and are studying the means of
awakening it with this new programming. What purpose do they have for
it? Are you sworn to aid them or stop them?
```

**DEVOTANT OF THE COLOSSI** [[]]][[]]]

```
Those who now worship the colossi believe they are the mechanized
embodiment of long-forgotten gods, and dedicate their lives to
serving them. Many of these cultists are sworn guardians for dormant
colossi. Others scour precursor lore, gather relics, and search vaults
for the means of awakening them. If they succeed, our doom may be
at hand.

```
Tactics ✴ Camouflage within its environment

✴ Lash out with keen-edged limbs
```

### Crystallid

Crystallids are beautiful but dangerous crystalline lifeforms that take a  
variety of sizes and shapes. Some are small and insect-like, skittering  
across the surface of rugged worlds or within cavernous depths. Others  
are much larger than a human, with a vaguely bestial form. A few can  
even sprout multifaceted wings to take to the air. Their lustrous coloration  
changes to mimic their environment, and they often appear as simply a  
part of the landscape until an unwitting explorer happens across them.

Crystallids are mineral hoarders. Their hidden burrows hold a cache  
of precious stones and valuable ores. For this reason, explorers and  
prospectors often attempt to track crystallids back to their nest. “The  
bigger the crystallid, the better the haul,” is a common saying among  
those audacious fortune hunters. But that potential motherlode is not  
taken without risk—crystallids are fierce protectors of their hoard.

```
Quest Starter: A prospector returns from a planetside expedition with
tales of an immense crystallid hoard of uncountable riches. But this
treasure is guarded by the largest, most aggressive crystallid they’ve ever
encountered, and they barely escaped with their life. They seek your help
in securing the nest in exchange for a share of the profits. What drives you
to accept this perilous bargain?
```

**CONVERGENT CRYSTALLID** [[[[][[[[]

```
Crystallids are not social creatures. They greedily compete for
resources to stock their hoard, and fight savagely among themselves.
But when facing a powerful threat, they merge into a communal being.
This monstrous form bristles with crystalline spikes and assaults its
foes with a multitude of segmented limbs.
```

SAMPLE NPCS 261

```

```
Tactics ✴ Prowl passages and anchorages for easy prey
✴ Deploy gravity harpoons to grapple targets
✴ Board to seize cargo and commandeer vessels
```

### Drift Pirate

Drifts provide the means of interstellar travel across the Forge–but also  
offer myriad dangers for spacers. Chief among those threats are drift  
pirates: reavers and thieves who prowl eidolon passages and anchorages  
to seize ships and cargo for their own.

These pirates often live short, brutal lives, or survive long enough to see  
their near-constant exposure to drift energies and unshielded eidolon  
drives manifest as strange mutations. Despite that, most would not trade  
their chosen path for one of comfort or safety.

```
Quest Starter: A drift pirate captain seizes an experimental new e-drive,
and uses it to stalk ships with deadly efficiency. Who created this new
drive, and what are they willing to pay to get it back?
```

**PIRATE BOARDING PARTY** [[[]][[[]]

```
After reeling in a disabled ship, drift pirates breach the hull and swarm
the corridors. They target critical systems and compartments to seize
the ship and its cargo for their flotilla.
```

**PIRATE CUTLASS (VEHICLE)** [[[]][[[]]

```
Drift pirates often strip down commandeered vessels, taking what
they need to refit or augment their own ships. What’s left is discarded
or sold on the black market. A typical pirate cutlass is a haphazard
collection of parts, splashed with the colors and sigils of their
commanders, built for speed and brutish power. The imposing sight
of one of these fierce vessels is enough to send a chill through the
heart of even the boldest spacer.
```

```

```
Drives ✴ Ride the drifts
✴ Move together in dizzying patterns of light

```

```
Tactics ✴ Surround and envelop
✴ Absorb energy
```

### Ember Wisp

For some spacers, sighting these strange, spectral creatures on a  
spaceborne journey is a portent of a change in fortune. A few even profess  
to divine meaning from their elaborate, luminous dance, as people of old  
would interpret omens by studying the flight of birds. Others refer to the  
wisps as corpse lights, believing they are the spirits of ancient beings  
cursed to linger forever within the cold void between stars.

Less superstitious spacers swear on various methods of “shooing” wisps  
away—everything from cycling the engines to cutting power entirely for a  
minute or so and allowing the creatures to move on.

```
Quest Starter: Along a remote passage, a swarm of ember wisps left a
cargo ship stranded and without power. What crucial and time-sensitive
cargo does this ship carry? Who races against you to secure it?
```

**WISP CONGREGATION** [[]]][[]]]

```
In the depths of space where light and warmth are commodities,
ember wisps congregate around sources of energy—such as the
engine wake of a starship. Their dazzling display of light and motion is
an alluring sight for an isolated spacer. But they also pose a potential
threat; they can envelop the hull of a vessel, leeching the starship of
precious energy.

```

```
Tactics ✴ Strike sudden and swift

```

### Firestorm Trooper

The Forge is largely wild, uncharted territory, but armored firestorm  
troopers seek to plunder the whole of it in the name of their clans, their  
creed, or their inscrutable gods.

Striking with the speed and strength of a hurricane, they raid worlds and  
stations for resources and conscripts, leaving settlements in ruins. So  
deadly and effective are their tactics, that it’s often said if these zealots  
could only stop warring amongst themselves, their banners would fly  
across the breadth of the Forge.

```
Quest Starter: Despite conflicting creeds, several firestorm clans unite
beneath the banner of Torren the Purifier to invade the Terminus. Their
next target is a world at the nexus of trade lanes. What is this planet, and
why is it important to you?
```

**FIRESTORM RAIDING TEAM** [[[[][[[[]

```
Feared throughout the Forge for their brutal tactics and destructive

```
The bulky, ironclad dropships favored by firestorm clans are designed

### Flarewing Shark

The flarewing shark is a highly evolved, monstrously deadly creature. It is  
typical of the apex predators that lurk in the unfathomable depths of life-  
bearing ocean worlds.

Two wing-like appendages fan out from the back of the flarewing’s head.  
Each is studded with sensory nerves to detect the subtlest of movement,  
and tipped with bioluminescent lures. When the flarewing closes in on  
its prey, those wings arch forward to attract and enfold the unfortunate  
victim. Then, the wide jaws and multi-pronged teeth make short work of  
the meal.

```
Quest Starter: In the twilight zone of a tidally-locked watery planet, an
underwater mining settlement is the target of an ancient flarewing.
In the murk of those dark waters, the beast attacks dive teams, carrier
subs, dredging equipment—even undersea platforms. Operations are
now stalled, cutting off a key source of unprocessed fuel in the sector.
Meanwhile, the settlement’s leader, grief-stricken by the loss of someone
dear to them, vows to destroy the flarewing. What is your relation to this
person? Do you support them in their obsession, or is there a way for the
settlers to coexist with this creature?
```

**MEGA FLAREWING** [[[[[[[[[[

```
At its perch atop the food chain, a flarewing is safe from other
predators and has a typical lifespan of several hundred years. They
continue to grow well beyond maturity, reaching incredible size.
The most ancient of these beasts are as large as a space cruiser,
fiercely territorial, and keenly intelligent. The ghostly shimmer of their
bioluminescent lures is a harbinger of imminent death.

### Ghost

Ghosts are undead spirits held in the boundary of life and death by forces  
beyond our knowing. These restless phantasms may be tied to a location,  
an object, or even a person.

Their form and nature varies. Some ghosts seek absolution. Others want  
revenge. Many are so sundered by a traumatic or unjust death that only a  
tormented, destructive shell of their former selves remain.

Ghosts might manifest in a physical form or assault with physical force, but  
they cannot be defeated through violence. To vanquish a ghost, you must  
instead find the key to unshackle them from our reality.

```
Quest Starter: A ghost haunts your starship. What is the nature of this spirit,
and what quest must you undertake to put it to rest?
```

**GHOST SHIP (VEHICLE)** [[[]][[[]]

```
These forsaken ships cruise through the depths of the Forge, carried
by relentless inertia. They are dark and cold, and might initially seem
a lucky find to a scavenger or pirate. But those who dare to trespass
within these haunted vessels are not alone, and the tormented
inhabitants will soon make themselves known.

### Gnawling

The bane of all spacers, the cable-chewing vermin known as gnawlings  
are a common pest aboard starships throughout the Forge. Adept at  
navigating in low or zero gravity with their long, multi-jointed limbs, these  
creatures emerge from cargo holds and engineering bays to gather  
and consume food. It’s said a gnawling could digest an eidolon drive,  
and there’s some truth to that adage—their digestive systems barely  
differentiate between organic and inorganic material.

Though not a grave threat individually, if left to their own devices,  
gnawlings are capable of quickly overrunning even large vessels. More  
than a few horror stories exist of scavengers cracking the airlock seal on  
a derelict only to find it crawling with thousands of these vile, chittering  
things.

Glowcats are a common gnawling deterrent, employed aboard cargo  
ships to keep the vermin at bay.

```
Quest Starter: An orbital settlement is overrun by gnawlings and
abandoned. What precious thing still lies within? Why are you sworn to
retrieve it from this infested place?
```

**GNAWLING BROOD MOTHER** [[[]][[[]]

```
These mutated creatures often dwell at the heart of a rampant
gnawling infestation. They are many times the size of a gnawling,
and protect their nest and broodlings with savage cunning.

### Howlcat

The howlcat dwells in the shadows below the canopy of a verdant jungle  
world. It has a lean, powerful form, is armed with curving claws and fangs,  
and moves unseen through the half-light of the jungle thanks to its sleek,  
blue-gray fur.

Unnervingly, the howlcat’s heavy skull possesses no eyes. Instead, it is  
crowned by large ears and a glossy bioacoustic organ. Through its distinct,  
chilling call, it uses echolocation to perceive its surroundings and stalk its  
prey with uncanny precision.

If you find yourself hunted by a howlcat, beware the moment when its  
calls fall silent; it is about to strike.

```
Quest Starter: A long-abandoned settlement, now reclaimed by the jungle,
holds something of value or importance. But there is no clear landing site
near the settlement, and the surrounding lands are home to a pack of
fearsome howlcats. What is it you seek in that forsaken place, and how will
you avoid becoming a howlcat’s next meal?
```

**HOWLCAT PACK** [[[]][[[]]

```
Though deadly on its own, the howlcat usually hunts in a pack of three
or four of its kind. Prowling through the jungle, a pack of howlcats can
surround and overwhelm their prey with lethal prowess, coordinating
their attacks via shrill calls.

### Iron Auger

Augers are an ancient precursor technology. These machines fuel their  
operation through an incessant hunger for minerals and metals, boring  
into asteroids, scouring small airless planetoids—even grappling onto  
space stations and starships.

A few bold fortune hunters have taken up auger hunting as a trade, setting  
out in harpoon-equipped starships to snare the great machines. The  
metals and technology of a dismantled auger can fetch a hefty price, but  
even the most skilled hunters are likely to see their ship made fodder for  
a machine’s hunger.

```
Quest Starter: As a massive auger approaches an orbital station under
your protection, you face a difficult choice. Do you find a way to evacuate
and save who you can, or attempt to bring down the mighty machine?
```

**MACHINE MITES** [[]]][[]]]

```
Iron augers self-replicate by producing swarms of tiny machine spawn.
When those offspring come within range of a source of minerals or
metals, they latch onto it and begin consuming the energy-giving
material. Experienced spacers make a close inspection of their ship
when pulling into port; a horde of undetected machine mites can
eventually strip a craft of its outer hull.
```

**PLANET-EATER** [[[[[[[[[[

```
Over time, an iron auger grows in size and power as it greedily
processes scavenged materials and reconstructs its own form. Some
spacers tell stories of an auger so titanic that it devours entire worlds
to feed the furnaces of its mighty engines.

### Puppet Vine

A puppet vine is a parasitic, plant-like entity. It is usually encountered as  
thorny, fleshy tendrils sprouting from the dessicated corpse of an unwilling  
host—a creature or careless explorer. That victim, skin shriveled tight  
against their bones, mouth agape in a silent scream, is made a horrific  
marionette as the vine takes control of their motor functions to send them  
shambling about in search of new hosts.

When the vine encounters a potential victim, it lashes out, entangling  
them, cutting into their flesh with hollow thorns. It uses those thorns to  
implant microscopic seeds. After a few hours, the seeds mature and  
sprout. Unless stopped, the fast-growing tendrils course greedily through  
the victim’s body, consuming the fluids within. Then, the vines burst forth  
to begin the cycle anew.

```
Quest Starter: At a remote settlement, a settler is attacked by a puppet
vine and infected. The outpost’s fast-thinking healer puts the victim in
stasis, stopping—for now—the sprouting and spread of the vines. But time
is of the essence. They need someone to transport the stasis pod and its
unfortunate occupant to a distant facility for treatment, and your ship is the
only one currently planetside. What do they offer to gain your help in this
risky mission?
```

**FLOWERING PUPPET VINE** [[[]][[[]]

```
After a host is reduced to decaying, mummified flesh and cracked
bones, the puppet vine remains anchored to the now-immobile
corpse. In this final stage of its life-cycle, the vines sprout alluring
crimson flowers to attract unwary victims.

### Pyralis

On scorching worlds of fire and ash, only the most resilient survive. The  
pyralis is a cunning predator that spends most of its life gliding among  
boiling ash clouds, using its sensitive, smoke-piercing vision to spot  
unwary prey.

This beast’s form is an intimidating fusion of insect, crustacean and  
hawk. Its outer shell and plated wings protect it from heat and flame, but  
it is pitted and scarred by innumerable collisions with airborne volcanic  
fragments. Its most fearsome aspect is a segmented tail, which it uses to  
deliver a powerful, paralyzing toxin to its unfortunate prey.

They are asexual and solitary creatures, and mark the bounds of their  
hunting grounds with intricate cairns built from the bones of their victims.  
If a rival pyralis passes overhead, the sight of that marker is forewarning  
that they are straying into another’s domain.

```
Quest Starter: A critically damaged spaceship is stranded amid the
hellscape of a furnace world. You are sworn to rescue the crew of this ill-
fated vessel, but the frequent ash storms prevent vehicular operations—
you’ll need to make the perilous journey on foot. To make matters worse,
the wreck is within the territory of a particularly aggressive and powerful
pyralis. How will you survive the journey across its hunting grounds?
```

**PYRALIS YOUNGLING** [[]]][[]]]

```
The carapace of a dying pyralis cracks and falls away to reveal a
single, stone-like egg. This offspring, slowly nurtured by the heat of
the fiery landscape, finally emerges after several months. Smaller
than its progenitor but no less fierce, the youngling immediately
takes flight and goes on the hunt.

### Risen

In the Forge, strange energies, alien contagions, and ancient, esoteric  
technologies can sunder the divide between life and death. Often found  
in places of great destruction or suffering—battlefields, derelict ships,  
the ruins of forsaken settlements—the risen protect their place of death  
fiercely and eternally.

To say the risen hate the living is untrue; to hate something would require  
sentience, emotion. Risen are robotic in their duties, automatic in their  
violence. They wield the weapons they carried in life to better harm their  
foes, and when that fails, they rake with bony, claw-like fingers. Their  
garments hang in bloodstained tatters. Their emaciated flesh, stretched  
taught over their misshapen bones, only hints at the living, breathing  
human they were before this curse befell them.

Many spacers spin tales of shambling risen encountered on abandoned  
colony worlds or derelict space cruisers. But perhaps most horrifyingly, it’s  
said the risen can survive decades in the vacuum of space before latching  
onto a passing ship or attacking engineers making exterior repairs.

```
Quest Starter: Hundreds died in an industrial accident within an orbital
facility, and are said to now be twice-born as risen. Triggering a reactor
meltdown will obliterate this place and put its undead inhabitants to rest.
Why are you sworn to see it done?
```

**CHIMERA** [[[[][[[[]

```
When many beings perish in the same site, the chaotic forces of
the Forge can create a chimera—multiple undead bodies fused into
a twisted, massive entity that knows only pain and hunger. When a
dozen blood-tinged eyes focus on you, when the gibbering mouths
open at once to scream, your only hope is a quick death.
```

SAMPLE NPCS 275

### Scrap Bandit

Scrap bandits roam the fringes of settled sectors, preying on planetside  
outposts. They survive by seizing provisions, resources, and equipment  
from those places. Because these raiders tend to revisit fruitful settlements,  
they do what they can to avoid razing them to the ground or leaving the  
settlers with less than they need to survive. “Never let a field go fallow,” is  
a common scrap bandit expression.

```
Quest Starter: In a far-flung sector, a titanic creature threatens a key
planetside settlement. The only possible defense against this beast is the
mighty war rig belonging to a clan of scrap bandits. But can you convince
the bandits to risk their rig to protect the settlers? If so, what will they
demand in return?
```

**HOVER PROWLERS** [[[]][[[]]

```
Teams of bandits, riding jerry-built hoverbikes and skiffs, are the
vanguard for planetside raids. They scout settlement defenses, ride
as escort for the clan’s war rig, and create chaos to overrun defenders.
```

**WAR RIG (VEHICLE)** [[[[][[[[]

```
At the onset of a raid, a scrap bandit clan’s war rig is deployed by a
heavy transport ship beyond a settlement’s defenses. These mobile
fortresses vary in form and function—some use hover tech, others
thunder across the landscape on wheels or treads, a few trudge
along on articulated metal legs. All are heavily armored, bristling with
weapons, and fiercely defended by the bandits. The mere sight of the
rig as it approaches is often enough for a settlement to surrender and
agree to any demand.

### Servitor

The inhospitable environments and dangerous sites of the Forge  
sometimes prove too volatile for even the most dogged spacers—and  
that’s where servitors come in.

Servitors come in a variety of shapes and sizes, often built to serve a  
specific duty—everything from loading cargo to surveying systems to  
boarding enemy ships. These bots sometimes possess lifelike qualities,  
like speech synthesizers or face-plates made to mimic expressions, to  
better endear them to humans. Others are given frightful or intimidating  
features, to better keep those humans in line.

Rarely, a servitor will live to outgrow its programming, and begin the  
process of gaining sentience to forge its own path. These awoken bots  
are feared or misunderstood by many, but can sometimes find a home for  
themselves on starship crews or on fringe settlements where they earn  
the trust and friendship of their peers.

```
Quest Starter: An awakened bot, recently struck out on their own, is
looking for work on a starship venturing out into the Expanse. They say
they are in search of a relic of the past—something that might shed some
light on their own creation. What is it they seek, and why do you vow to
help them?
```

**ENFORCER BOT** [[[]][[[]]

```
Though most often encountered as labor and service units, many
servitors are deployed as brutes, guards, and soldiers. Their
resistance to damage and survivability in harsh environs makes them
ideal fighters for those who can afford them. Enforcers are often used
by tyrannical factions to keep settlements passive and productive.
```

278 CHAPTER 4: FOES AND ENCOUNTERS

### Sicklehorn

The sicklehorn are mammalian herd animals bred by settlers throughout  
the Forge. They are adaptable to most climates and terrain, have iron  
constitutions, and are prized for the versatile and valuable milk produced  
by their females. Aside from its nutritive properties, the milk can be  
processed in a number of ways to manufacture potent medicines and  
powerful narcotics.

A herd of sicklehorn are often sent with groups attempting to found a new  
planetside settlement. With careful breeding, the settlers can produce  
enough meat and milk to sustain themselves and trade for needed  
supplies. But sicklehorn are range animals, and raiders and rustlers often  
target a vulnerable herd. The creatures—especially a matriarch—are a  
valuable commodity.

```
Quest Starter: A settlement’s prized sicklehorn matriarch has been stolen,
the herd is in disarray, and the settlers won’t survive another year without
her return. The theft is blamed on a rival settlement on the same planet,
but raiders also plague this sector. How are you involved?
```

**SICKLEHORN MATRIARCH** [[[]][[[]]

```
A powerful matriarch leads each sicklehorn herd. She is larger than
other members, with a thicker hide and more elaborate horns. A
matriarch is formidable on her own, but typically has the strongest
members of the herd by her side.
```

**SICKLEHORN STAMPEDE** [[[]][[[]]

```
Sicklehorns are gentle-natured, but when startled or facing a threat,
they will stampede as a group. A herd of charging sicklehorn can run
at incredible speeds over the most rugged of terrain, laying waste to
anything in its path.

### Sky Roost

Sky roosts are massive creatures that drift in the buoyant upper  
atmosphere of a Jovian world. Their broad, scalloped mantle unfurls to  
catch updrafts as sinuous feelers extract water, minerals, and organisms  
from the dense cloud layers below.

A roost’s wide cap and warm, glowing core shelters a complex ecosystem  
of other lifeforms. A few of these resident creatures live out their entire  
lives within the refuge of a single roost; others come and go as they hunt  
within the Jovian skies or migrate among distant habitats.

Roosts are enormous and long-lived, but fragile. In a symbiotic trade for  
shelter, the inhabitants provide protection against large predators and  
other threats, and their discarded food and waste help fuel the roost’s  
sluggish metabolism.

As a roost navigates the currents and eddies of the Jovian atmosphere,  
the expansion and contraction of its internal air bladders is heard as a  
deep, resounding call. As other roosts respond, the shared, plaintive song  
reverberates among the clouds.

```
Quest Starter: Sky roosts are dying. A disease is spreading among them,
threatening the delicate ecosystem of their world. What human operations
do you suspect lie at the heart of this sickness?
```

**ROOST SWARM** [[[[][[[[]

```
When a roost is threatened, the symbiotic lifeforms it shelters
mobilize to protect their home. The compulsion to defend the roost is
so strong that the swarm’s instinct for self preservation is suppressed.
They attack in a fierce cyclone of wing, teeth, and claw.

### Technoplasm

Theorized to be a precursor bioweapon that persisted long beyond the  
death of its creators, technoplasm is a malignant lifeform that infects,  
mutates, and controls machines, robots, and computer systems.

Technoplasm infestations are tenacious, cunning, and dangerous to  
eliminate. When in doubt, burn it and deal with the aftermath that comes  
with generous applications of fire. A ship or settlement with a large  
outbreak is likely too far gone and best abandoned, although some  
suggest every infection has its source; if you somehow find and destroy  
the heart of a technoplasm infestation, can you kill it entirely?

```
Quest Starter: An outcast cult believes technoplasm is the ultimate
synthesis of machine and flesh. They are plotting to unleash it upon
populated space. What decisive first strike have they set in motion, and
how do you learn of their scheme?
```

**INFECTED BOT** [[]]][[]]]

```
When bots fall prey to technoplasm outbreaks, they are transformed
into horrific amalgams of machine and living proto-ooze. Once
subsumed, they set out to serve the primitive impulses of the infection,
defending affected sites and finding new machines to corrupt.
```

**SCOURGE SHIP (VEHICLE)** [[[[][[[[]

```
These corrupted vessels, their crews long-dead, their hulls wracked
by creeping slime and grasping pseudopods, prowl the depths
of the Forge in search of new ships and stations to infect. Inside,
the gelatinous mass of the technoplasm slithers through darkened
corridors. Tendrils of the ooze bore into bulkheads and machinery
like marbleized fat through a chunk of meat.

### Void Shepherd

Void shepherds are benevolent creatures about the size of a snub fighter,  
They propel themselves through space on trails of vibrant energy, and  
seem to delight in riding the wake of starships. For spacers navigating  
the lonely depths of the Forge, they are welcome company and a sign of  
good fortune.

Many spacers tell stories of being aided by a void shepherd pod. These  
creatures have an extraordinary intuition, and can escort a wayward  
spacer back to the right path, guide them away from danger, or lead them  
toward unseen opportunities.

When threatened, shepherds charge and ram with their armored snouts.  
If this doesn’t dissuade their foe, a pod harmonizes their energy output to  
unleash a burst of electromagnetic force; this attack can daze a creature  
or knock out a ship’s critical systems.

```
Quest Starter: Several pods of void shepherds shelter within the debris of
a shattered world. An expansive mining operation is harvesting the ore-
rich rocks of the system, and the shepherds dance playfully in the wake of
prospector and transport ships. But an aberrant, predatory creature has
made this place its hunting ground, posing a threat to both the shepherd
pods and the miners. What is the nature of this creature, and why are you
sworn to end its attacks?
```

**SHEPHERD POD** [[[[][[[[]

Void shepherds are communal beings, and typically travel in groups
of a dozen or more. When facing a danger, they coordinate to protect
the young and vulnerable of the pod.

### Warden

The origin of these long-lived humans is a secret lost to time. Whether  
through precursor tech, alien organisms, or genetic mutation, they were  
modified with unnatural strength, endurance, and survivability. They can  
withstand the harshest of environments. Their wounds heal quickly. They  
are resistant to sickness and disease.

More than a century ago, the wardens served as elite soldiers, protecting  
the people of the Forge against the many threats of this galaxy. But as  
often happens, their purpose was subverted by those who sought to wield  
them as weapons. Conflicts flared among powerful factions. Wardens  
faced their comrades on innumerable battlefields. The chaos might have  
ended us all, had not the wardens rebelled against those who used them  
as cogs in the machines of war.

```
Quest Starter: There are rumors of an enclave well beyond the inhabited
sectors, a place where wardens can live in peace. An emerging threat
against the people of the Forge causes you to seek out the aid of these
living relics. What do you offer in return for their help?
```

**WARDEN COHORT** [[[[][[[[]

```
Many of the surviving wardens left the battlefield behind, but some
now serve as guns-for-hire, banding together to form small mercenary
companies. Five wardens are as effective as fifty soldiers.
```

**FURY** [[[[[[[[[[

```
The modifications that gave rise to the wardens can result in rare
mutations that ravage their mind and body, stripping away their
humanity. Wardens call these monstrous lost souls the furies, and are
haunted by the possibility they may someday become one of them.

### Waterwitcher

Water is life. On rugged planets in fringe sectors, the technology to  
locate fresh water or process contaminated water is not always available  
or reliable. Many struggling settlements resort to a low-tech solution—a  
dowser and their waterwitcher companion.

Waterwitchers are stout, furred creatures with fierce-looking retractable  
claws on their forelegs. On their homeworld, which was lost a decade ago  
in a stellar calamity, they used those claws to dig through the arid, rocky  
ground, and had an unerring knack for finding hidden water sources. Some  
of the human settlers who fled the doomed planet adopted waterwitchers  
as companions, and now travel the Forge with their furry friends in tow.

Waterwitchers were a precious part of their ecosystem, and were not  
preyed upon by other creatures. This made them gentle and trusting to a  
fault. They often greet potential new friends with enthusiastic sniffing and  
contented purring. For their dowser companions, it’s an unrelenting effort  
to keep them out of trouble.

```
Quest Starter: A dowser has gone missing in the vast wastes of a newly-
settled desert world, leaving behind their distraught waterwitcher. You are
sworn to find the wayward dowser, and must serve as an unlikely keeper
for their furry companion. What is your relationship to the dowser?
```

**DOWSER** [[]]][[]]]

```
Waterwitchers are good-natured creatures, and form a close bond
with their human handlers. Those folk, the dowsers, rove among
remote settlements, peddling their water-finding services to
desperate settlers.

### WORLDBREAKER [[[[][[[[]

The scale and strength of the worldbreakers is so beyond our reckoning  
that some consider them godlike beings. Capable of thriving on verdant  
jungle worlds, frozen planets, worlds scorched by volcanic activity, and  
even within barren asteroids in the vacuum of space, these worms possess  
a wisdom and a cunning that makes them a deadly threat for even the  
most competent spacer.

Worldbreakers range in size from about the size of a cargo hauler to an  
unfathomable scale that dwarfs our largest starship. They bore tunnels  
to pursue their prey, and hibernate in those dark depths to conserve  
energy. Though blind, worldbreaker worms can detect even the subtlest  
of footfalls, and they follow these vibrations to eventually consume their  
quarry—along with any other creatures, starships, or structures that  
happen to be nearby.

```
Quest Starter: On a lush world at the edge of the Terminus, a titanic
worldbreaker worm holds sway. One faction seeks to destroy the worm so
that the riches of this place can be harvested. Another swears to protect it.
On which side do you fall?
```

**WORLDBREAKER BROOD** [[[]][[[]]

```
The young of the worldbreakers are a fraction of the size of their older
counterparts, yet still dwarf most humans, and boast a voracious
appetite. Unlike their solitary parents, immature worms hunt in small
packs, working together to burrow beneath easy prey.
```

**ELDER WORM** [[[[[[[[[[

```
Elder worms, those centuries or even millennia old, are the largest and
most formidable of the worldbreakers, and yet the least aggressive.
They follow inscrutable whims, live in harmony with surrounding flora
and fauna, and only hunt when absolutely necessary.

## USING THE USING THE ORACLESORACLES

In Starforged, an oracle is anything that generates random results to  
help determine the outcome of an action, an aspect of your setting, or a  
narrative event. Use your preferred prompts while playing the game, or  
use the wide array of oracles provided in this chapter.

The oracles on the following pages are in the form of random tables, and  
are customized to the tone, setting, and gameplay of Starforged. Some  
oracles are for specific, mundane questions to streamline play (“What is  
the engineer’s name?”). Others provide more abstract results that you  
interpret based on the current situation (“What goes wrong?”). Perhaps  
most importantly, there are a variety of oracles in this chapter to help  
envision what you discover as you navigate and explore the Forge. These  
range from identifying the nature of a star to generating the forsaken  
interior of a derelict starship.

### Oracles in Solo and Co-op Play

If you are playing without a guide, you can Ask the Oracle and use the  
tables and generators in this chapter to help reveal details and resolve  
actions during play.

Keep in mind that Starforged oracles don’t function as a scripted emulator  
to replace a GM or guide. Instead, they use the power of creative  
interpretation to help you fill that role. Ask your question, roll on a table,  
and consider the answer in the context of your current situation and story.  
What comes to mind first? Did you think of something that reinforces  
your dramatic narrative or takes things in an interesting and surprising  
direction? Does it feel right? If so, make it happen.

If you follow your instincts while staying open to twists and turns, you  
will find your game offering many of the same narrative rewards as if  
you were playing with a guide. In fact, you’ll be surprised how often a  
seemingly random result feeds directly into your character’s story and  
the world you’ve established through play. This is the power of creative  
interpretation at work.

### Oracles in Guided Play

Guides can use oracles for support during play and to supplement their  
narrative decision-making. Mundane oracles, such as a Character Name  
(pages 333 – 335 ), are helpful to quickly flesh out details. Interpretative  
oracles, such as the Action and Theme tables (pages 296 – 297 ), can be  
used to spark new ideas.

You can also use oracles as a prompt for sharing control of the narrative  
with your players. Not sure what happens next? Don’t know how to answer  
a player’s question? Roll on an appropriate table, or have a player make  
the roll, and talk it out.

USING THE ORACLES 291

```
If you’ve got your answer, you’re all set! Envision the result
and play to see what happens. If you want further detail, talk
it out with other players or roll on another table.
```

```
If you’re still having trouble, roll again, try a different table,
or just fall back to your instincts and decide an answer.
```

```
If the answer is a bad fit for your situation—or if it prompts
an interpretation that compromises a player’s comfort or
safety—change or adjust it. You can check up or down one
row from your original result for another response.
```

```
Consider the oracle’s answer in the context of your question
and the current situation. Is the result a good fit? Does it
trigger a spark of inspiration?
```

```
Check the 1–100 result against the oracle table to reveal
the answer.
```

```
Roll your oracle dice to generate a number from 1–100.
```

```
Ask your question and choose an appropriate oracle table.
```

### Oracle Tips and Tricks

#### PEELING THE ONION

The oracles in this chapter often provide layers of detail through multiple  
tables. For example, the Character oracles (page 330) include several  
tables to help envision someone’s role, look, nature, and name. It might  
be tempting to roll on every table at once to generate a more fully formed  
encounter, but that can slow down your game and work against the  
opportunity to gain insight through the course of your story.

Do this instead: When initially encountering a place, creature, or  
person, use the oracle tables only for details you would perceive as first  
impressions. Make a roll or two, envision the result as appropriate to the  
situation, make some assumptions to fill in the gaps, and move on with  
your story. You are playing to see what happens. Think of each roll as  
peeling a layer of the narrative onion to reveal a new detail.

```
You encounter another character while exploring a remote planet.
To set the stage for the encounter, you use the Character generator
and roll on the First Look table. The result tells you that this person
is “Wounded” and “Ill-equipped.” You envision someone who was
clearly not prepared for an expedition on this perilous planet, and
was gravely wounded following an encounter with a native creature.
Next you roll on the Initial Disposition table to help envision their
reaction. The oracle responds, “Suspicious.”
```

Over time, you can build on the starting knowledge and Ask the Oracle to  
reveal additional aspects.

```
You manage to gain the trust of this unlucky fellow explorer, and
patch them up enough to get them on their feet for a journey back
to your ship. Through the course of your interaction, you envision
asking questions to learn more about them and their predicament.
You roll on the Name, Role, and Goal tables. Taking those responses
and expanding on them with interpretation, you conclude that this
person is a smuggler, abandoned here and left for dead by double-
crossing crewmates. If you end up on a prolonged adventure with
this character, you might roll on the Revealed Aspects table to learn
more about their personality, quirks, and abilities.
```

The oracles often include labels that help guide these staggered  
reveals. For example, planetary aspects are divided into separate  
tables for Observed from Space and Planetside Feature. With some  
experience, you’ll develop your own preferences for how and when to  
reveal new details.

USING THE ORACLES 293

#### INSPIRATION AND RANDOMNESS

The oracle tables can generate random results, but you’re free to just scan  
a table and pick an option that is a good fit. This is particularly true when  
building on established facts and a result is already known to be true. For  
example, if you’re on a planet and encounter a settlement, you don’t need  
to roll for a location on the settlement generator; you already know it is  
“planetside.”

However, keep in mind that the generators—particularly for encounters  
and locations—are often structured to include a mix of common and  
rare answers. For example, coming upon a Vital World on a spaceborne  
expedition is an unlikely and wondrous discovery. Consider these  
assumptions when choosing or interpreting oracle results.

RESULTS BY REGION

Location oracles are often structured with results organized by the main  
regions of the Forge: Terminus, Outlands, and Expanse. Check the result  
for your current location. If you are playing in another setting, you can  
think of those regions as translating to Settled, Frontier, and Uncharted.

BUILDING ORACLE ARRAYS

The wide variety of oracles in this chapter provide a toolkit that you can  
use and combine as you like. You’ll often have options for what table  
to roll on for a specific location or situation. Once you’ve gained some  
experience using the oracles, check out page 384 for advice on building  
Oracle Arrays that are tuned to your preferences.

### Common Symbols

#### MULTIPLE RESULTS

Some oracles provide a recommended range of results. This is shown as  
a looping arrow with the suggested number of rolls. For example: @1–2.  
Depending on the situation, you might make multiple rolls at once, or  
make them over time to “peel the onion” and reveal new aspects.

All other tables are assumed to default to a single roll, but some oracles  
include an embedded result that prompts you to make multiple rolls. This  
is typically shown as “Roll twice.” If you get this result, roll twice more  
on the table and combine those results. If you get “Roll twice” yet again,  
ignore it and redo the roll.

LINKS TO OTHER TABLES

Oracle answers will often prompt you to jump to another oracle. This is  
shown as an arrow symbol with the name(s) of the oracle. For example:

> Starship. If you see this prompt, that’s your cue to go to that section or  
> table to reveal more about the encounter. If you are reading this rulebook  
> on a digital device, those links are clickable.

294 CHAPTER 5: ORACLES

## CORE ORACLESCORE ORACLES

The following pages include a set of four Core Oracles that are central  
to Starforged. They are: Action, Theme, Descriptor, and Focus. Each  
includes 100 single-word results as abstract prompts.

You can roll on these tables individually or combine them with results  
from other oracles. In most cases, you’ll roll on a set of two oracles—  
Action and Theme or Descriptor and Focus—to form a simple sentence  
out of a word pair. Then, interpret the result based on the context of the  
question and your current situation. If a result doesn’t fit, check adjacent  
rows or roll again.

The Core Oracles provide creative prompts suitable for many situations.  
In fact, for a lightweight approach, it’s possible to ignore the other oracles  
and focus on answering questions using only the Ask the Oracle move  
and these four tables.

ACTION AND THEME (PAGES 296 – 298 )

Use these oracle tables to reveal details about a goal, situation, or event.  
They provide a word or phrase that can be taken literally or interpreted  
as an abstraction.

Action and Theme can answer questions such as:

```
✴ “What does this character want?”
✴ “What is this faction’s mission?”
✴ “What caused the downfall of this settlement?”
✴ “What is this device’s purpose?”
```

DESCRIPTOR AND FOCUS (PAGES 298 – 299 )

Use these oracles to generate the details of a location, discovery, or  
encounter. The Descriptor oracle is particularly handy for quick generation  
of a location. For example, use it to describe the basic nature of a planet  
instead of rolling on the detailed planet oracles.

Descriptor and Focus can answer questions such as:

```
✴ “What is this ship’s cargo?”
✴ “What is the nature of this planet?”
✴ “What is inside this station?”
✴ “What hazard do I encounter?”
```

### Space Sighting

300300 CHAPTER 5: ORACLESCHAPTER 5: ORACLES

### Summary: Exploring Space

The Space Sightings table on the previous page is your nexus for  
envisioning the vistas and encounters of your spaceborne journeys. This  
is particularly useful for revealing what is in range when you reach an  
anchorage (page 68) on an interstellar expedition. You can also use it  
to identify the destination or focus of a spaceborne quest.

Since space is incomprehensibly vast and empty, don’t feel obligated  
to use the Space Sightings oracle for every waypoint on an interstellar  
journey. Instead, you may assume there is nothing of note and move on.  
Roll for a sighting only when you are inspired to inject uncertainty, danger,  
strangeness, or narrative potential into your story. Some of these results  
will be mundane, but others will lead to new wonders or hazards.

Other oracles in this section include:

```
✴ If you are introducing a sector of space into your story, use the
Sector Name oracle (page 302) to give it a random name.
✴ Use the Stellar Object oracle (page 303) to learn more about the
primary star at a location. This is mostly to help you visualize your
surroundings, but the strange or hazardous nature of some rare stars
can incite new adventures.
✴ The Spaceborne Peril and Spaceborne Opportunity oracles (pages
304 – 305 ) can help identify the nature of a deep space event.
```

### PLANETARY CLASSPLANETARY CLASS

306306 CHAPTER 5: ORACLESCHAPTER 5: ORACLES

### Summary: Exploring Planets

The chart on the previous page provides a simple method of generating a  
planetary class. If this is enough information, stop there and envision the  
world as appropriate to its type. For a bit more detail, make a roll on the  
Descriptor oracle (page 298 ) and envision how that aspect defines the  
nature of the planet or a specific planetside location.

DETAILED PLANET GENERATION

Using the planet dashboards on the following pages, you can generate  
details for the features of a planet if that place has a focus in your story.

Start with the tables that describe features you’d detect at a distance,  
such as Atmosphere, Settlements, and Observed from Space. Then, if you  
investigate the planet, roll on the Planetside Feature and Life tables to  
uncover more about the nature of that place.

If you have advance information on a planet, you’ll have a more complete  
picture before you travel there. In that case, roll to determine its nature as  
you like. If you are the guide, assemble the characteristics of a planet as  
needed.

PLANET ATMOSPHERES

The atmosphere table for each planet type includes a range of results to  
help you envision a planet’s habitability.

```
✴ None / thin: This planet is airless, or its atmosphere is so thin as to
be useless for humans.
✴ Toxic: This planet’s atmosphere is not compatible with human life.
Exploring this place will require a sealed environment or breathing
apparatus. Otherwise, survival is measured in minutes.
✴ Corrosive: This planet’s atmosphere is deadly to humans. As a bonus,
it can damage exposed skin, materials, plastics, and metals over time.
✴ Marginal: It’s unhealthy to breathe this planet’s atmosphere for more
than a few hours at a time.
✴ Breathable: This atmosphere is not perfect, but it’s good enough to
sustain human life.
✴ Ideal: This planet’s atmosphere is ideally suited to human life.
```

ENVISIONING PLANETSIDE EXPEDITIONS

Planets are big. These oracles help set the stage, but won’t provide the  
moment-to-moment details of a surface expedition. Instead, use the  
established nature of a planet as a springboard for envisioning terrain  
and encounters. Save the Planetside Feature table for key aspects. Roll  
on the Descriptor and Focus oracles (pages 298 – 299 ) for additional  
variety. Use the Planetside Peril and Planetside Opportunity oracles  
(pages 320 – 321 ) to help envision the nature of an unexpected event.

### Summary: Exploring Derelicts

Derelicts are broken into zones for primary areas and functions. When  
you envision moving from one section to another while exploring a  
derelict, you may roll or choose on the zone chart on the opposite  
page to help identify what you find. If that’s enough detail, stop  
rolling and envision the nature of those spaces. You can also use the  
Descriptor and Focus oracles (pages 298 – 299 ) to generate additional  
aspects of a zone or as an alternative to rolling for a zone.

DETAILED DERELICT GENERATION

If you want to give your exploration of a derelict extra focus, use the zone  
oracles on the following pages. Each includes several tables.

```
✴ Area: Roll on this table to help envision the spaces you encounter
in that segment of your exploration. Each zone may consist of one
or more areas as appropriate to what you envision for the overall
complexity of the derelict. If you Undertake an Expedition, an area
can serve as a waypoint in your survey of the derelict.
✴ Feature: Roll on this table when you want to reveal new aspects
of your current surroundings. This is best used sparingly—a bit of
occasional extra detail or ambiance—rather than rolling for every
segment of your exploration.
✴ Peril: Roll on this table when you want help envisioning a complication
or danger within a zone, such as when suffering a cost as an outcome
of your exploration.
✴ Opportunity: Roll on this table when you want inspiration for a
beneficial encounter or event within a derelict, such as when you roll
a strong hit with a match as you Undertake an Expedition, or if you
Explore a Waypoint and find an opportunity.
```

If you encounter a prompt for a “New Zone” when rolling for an area, you  
are transitioning into a different section of the derelict, and can roll or  
envision that zone as you like. “New Zone via >Access” means you should  
first envision the connecting path between the old zone and the new; the  
Access oracles can help flesh this out.

SURVEYING A PREPARED SITE

If you envision your character with a map or scan of the derelict, or the  
goal of your exploration is to reach a specific zone (such as the bridge on a  
derelict starship), you can create a simple flow chart of the layout. Include  
zones and the access types that connect them. Leave some blank zones  
to discover during play. Use this map—along with rolls on the zone oracles  
as appropriate—to help envision your path through the site.

### Summary: Exploring Precursor Vaults

When you first come upon a vault, use the tables on the previous two  
pages to help envision its form and nature. For a more abstract prompt,  
just use the Descriptor oracle (page 298). In either case—if that’s enough  
detail for the role of the vault in your story—stop there.

DETAILED PRECURSOR VAULT GENERATION

If the survey of a vault is a focus for your current quest, use the oracle  
tables in this section to generate a more complete picture of the site. See  
the next page for a diagram of the three main phases of exploration.

```
✴ Exterior: Start by generating the basic form and characteristics of
the vault using the tables on the previous two pages. These features
represent what you observe from a safe distance.
✴ Interior: If you enter the site, check the Inner First Look table (page
364 ) for initial impressions of what lies within. If you explore further,
use the Interior Feature table (page 366) to define what you find or
encounter. If you Undertake an Expedition within a vault, check this
table if you want help setting the scene for a waypoint.
✴ Sanctum: As you delve deeper into a vault, the corruption and
strangeness of the place takes hold. Use the Sanctum Feature table
(page 368) to represent the aberrant nature of a vault’s depths.
```

DELVING THE SANCTUM

Your passage from the Interior into the Sanctum is triggered by a rolled  
result on the Interior Feature table: “Transition into the Sanctum.”

If you Undertake an Expedition into a vault, you can also use the progress  
track as a gauge for your current location. Once you reach six or more  
filled progress boxes, you have reached the Sanctum.

If you envision a vault as particularly strange and perilous, use the  
Sanctum as the framing for the entirety of your exploration. If it is relatively  
mundane, use only the Interior.

REVEALING THE VAULT’S PURPOSE

If the original function of the vault is a mystery, use the Vault Purpose table  
(page 365) to see what lies at its heart. Check this oracle when your  
story leads to a reveal of the site’s true nature, such as when you Finish  
an Expedition.

PERILS AND OPPORTUNITIES

Use these tables to help envision a complication or favorable circumstance  
within a vault, such as when you Explore a Waypoint and are prompted to  
envision a peril or opportunity.

### Summary: Exploring Themed Locations

Themes help you envision atmosphere, features, and encounters within  
an unusual, aberrant, or important location.

Each theme on the following pages includes a set of oracles.

```
✴ Feature: Use this table to reveal a new aspect of the location.
✴ Peril: Use this table to help envision a complication or hazard.
✴ Opportunity: Use this table to help envision a beneficial encounter
or event, such as when rolling a strong hit with a match in a location.
```

You can answer questions about a place using only the tables provided for  
a theme, such as when delving into an Infested cave. Or pair a theme with  
other location oracles for more flavor and variety; for example, you might  
explore a Haunted Grave World, a Ruined Derelict, a Sacred Precursor  
Vault, or an Inhabited Settlement.

When mixing-and-matching a theme with another set of tables, use the  
techniques described for an oracle array (page 384) to determine which  
oracle you reference for that question or phase of your exploration.

## MORE ORACLE OPTIONSMORE ORACLE OPTIONS

### Oracle Arrays

```
Starforged oracles offer many options for answering questions and
generating locations and encounters. But these options can slow down
your gameplay as you consider what table to use for a specific situation.
Don’t get overwhelmed. You’ll soon develop your own preferences.
Plus, using established facts and your intuition without needing to Ask
the Oracle will keep things moving. But if you want to play with all the
toys in the oracle toybox, while leaving some of the moment-to-moment
decisions in the hands of fate, an oracle array is your answer.
An oracle array is a collection of oracles you assemble to help answer
questions for a specific situation or location.
The key to an oracle array is your six-sided action die. To create an array,
you’ll assign the values of that die (1–6) to two or more oracle tables. When
you need inspiration for a situation or location associated with an array,
roll your action die alongside your oracle dice. This magically transforms
your action die into an array die for the purposes of this roll. Check the
value of the array die to see what table you’ll reference.
```

```
You’ve traveled to an orbital outpost, and roll a weak hit as you
Finish an Expedition. Per that move, you must suffer a complication
at the end of the journey. You aren’t sure how to resolve this new
trouble, so you consider what oracle table to use for inspiration. The
Story Complication oracle would be a good fit. Or you could assign
this settlement the Inhabited theme and roll on the Inhabited Peril
table. You decide to leave it in the hands of fate with an impromptu
oracle array. On a 1–4, you’ll use the Story Complication oracle.
On a 5–6, it’ll be an Inhabited Peril. You roll the 6-sided array die
alongside the oracle dice. It comes up as a 5, so you check the
value of the oracle dice against the Inhabited Peril table.

Arrays are an optional tool, but
mixing and matching oracle tables
within an array will arm you with a
rich collection of possibilities.
A simple ad-hoc array can be
quickly created while making an
oracle roll. More complex arrays for
a site or situation can be outlined
in your journal or on a note card for
repeated use.
```

```
384 CHAPTER 5: ORACLES
```

### Campaign Elements

A campaign elements oracle is a handcrafted table of story ingredients  
specific to your campaign. When you encounter or introduce an open-  
ended situation and want to know what is involved, or how it connects  
to something already established in your story, roll on your campaign  
elements oracle to learn the answer.

To create a campaign elements oracle, use the oracle worksheet (included  
in the Starforged Playkit), your journal, or a note card to build a roll table of  
10 or 20 items. This table can include narrative themes, people, factions,  
locations, troubles, quests, and other story threads.

STARTING ELEMENTS

If you’d like to begin your campaign  
with a campaign elements oracle,  
or create one for an in-progress  
campaign, here’s a suggestion of ten  
items to include. Adjust to your liking,  
particularly if playing with allies to allow  
for more character-focused entries.

```
✴ Narrative theme or motif (1)
✴ Ongoing situations or conflicts (2)
✴ Factions or cultural influences (2)
✴ Background vow (1)
✴ Important item or vehicle (1)
✴ Location in your current sector (1)
✴ Connection in the current sector (1)
✴ Trouble in the current sector (1)
```

MANAGING THE CAMPAIGN ELEMENT ORACLE

Your campaign elements oracle should be a dynamic resource, periodically  
changing to reflect the events of your story. Elements that are no longer a  
factor, or no longer interesting to you, can be removed. New elements that  
emerge during play can be added.

During a session, use your journal or a scratchpad to make note of elements  
you’d like to adjust. Then, when you End a Session, take a moment to  
update the table entries. When you need more room, “upgrade” your  
table to include more entries.

USING ELEMENT SUBTABLES

Want more detail? You can maintain separate tables for categories of  
campaign elements, such as notable people, key factions, important  
locations, and ongoing quests. This gives you the option to roll for an  
answer to a more specific question, such as where something is located  
or who is involved in a situation.

```
A final option for structuring oracle prompts is to construct
sentences or phrases with blanks for oracle answers. Creating
these mad libs and interpreting their meaning can be a fun
creative exercise to help kickoff or energize a campaign.

MORE ORACLE OPTIONSMORE ORACLE OPTIONS 387387

#### “ADD +X”

Add this value to your action die. For most action rolls, your action die +  
stat + adds is your final action score. If you gain multiple prompts to “add  
+x” for a single action, those bonuses stack.

“ACTION SCORE”

When making an action roll, the total of your action die, your stat, and  
any adds is your action score. The action score is never greater than 10—  
anything over that is ignored.

“ALLIES / ALLY”

An ally is a protagonist character controlled by another player.

“BEFORE ROLLING”

Some asset abilities include a benefit at a risk that must be decided prior  
to rolling the dice. When activating this ability, you must commit to the  
choice or cost before the dice hit the table.

“BURN MOMENTUM”

When you have positive momentum, after you make an action roll, you  
may replace your action score with your current momentum value to  
improve your result. See page 36 for details.

Some assets may offer additional benefits when you burn momentum, or  
will alter the result. But note that you cannot burn momentum unless it  
actually improves the outcome of the move, making a miss a hit or a weak  
hit a strong hit.

After you burn momentum, you must reset your momentum. The default  
reset is +2, but is reduced as you suffer impacts. See page 37 for details.

“COMPANION”

A companion is an NPC asset. See page 57 for details.

“COMPANION TAKES A HIT (-X)”

Make the Companion Takes a Hit move, suffering the indicated amount of  
harm to your companion’s health.

“CHOOSE”

The move will provide a list of options and the number you may select.  
Unless the move says otherwise, you may not select a single option more  
than once.

“ENDURE HARM (-X)”

Make the Endure Harm move, suffering the indicated amount of harm.

## MOVE AND ASSET GLOSSARY

388

#### “ENDURE STRESS (-X)”

Make the Endure Stress move, suffering the indicated amount of stress.

“ENVISION”

When you see “envision” as a prompt during gameplay, that’s your  
reminder to take a moment and put the focus on the fiction by imagining,  
describing, or discussing what is happening. If you’re unsure, Ask the  
Oracle, using the Starforged oracles to generate the details of a situation,  
location, person, creature, and more.

“IN CONTROL” / “IN A BAD SPOT”

In a fight (using combat moves), your character is in one of two positions:  
in control or in a bad spot. If you are in control, you can make proactive  
moves such as Gain Ground and Strike. When in a bad spot, your foes  
have the upper hand and you must make reactive moves such as React  
Under Fire and Clash.

When you make a move that doesn’t define whether you are in control or  
in a bad spot (such as a suffer move), follow these guidelines: On a strong  
hit, you are in control; on a weak hit or miss, you are in a bad spot.

See page 184 for details.

“LOSE MOMENTUM (-X)”

Make the Lose Momentum move, reducing your momentum meter by the  
indicated amount.

“MAKE A SUFFER MOVE (-X)”

Select a suffer move appropriate to the situation, and reduce the related  
condition meter by the listed amount.

“MARK [REWARD] ON YOUR QUESTS/BONDS/DISCOVERIES  
LEGACY TRACK”

Moves and asset abilities may prompt you to mark ticks or fill boxes in  
one or more of your legacy tracks. This is called a legacy reward. For  
example, if you Make a Discovery, you and your allies mark two ticks on  
your discoveries legacy track.

If you are successful as you make a progress move to Fulfill Your Vow,  
Forge a Bond, or Finish an Expedition, anyone who was part of the shared  
challenge earns the legacy reward and marks the appropriate legacy  
track. However, bonus legacy rewards granted by an asset are only for  
the character making the move, unless the ability specifically provides a  
reward for allies.

Legacy tracks are not given a rank, but are otherwise treated the same  
as standard progress tracks. It takes four ticks to fill a box. When you fill a  
legacy track box, make the Earn Experience move.

#### “MARK PROGRESS”

When a move or asset ability prompts you to mark progress, check the  
rank of the challenge and fill in the appropriate number of boxes or ticks  
in your progress track.

If a move prompts you to mark progress, and you have an asset ability that  
also instructs you to mark progress for that action, you may mark progress  
again. In other words, “mark progress” stacks. Every instance of progress  
earned within the same action allows you to mark the appropriate number  
of boxes or ticks per the rank of the challenge.

When you and your allies are working together to resolve a challenge—a  
quest, expedition, connection, or fight—you share a progress track. When  
a move prompts someone to mark progress for that challenge, it is marked  
on your shared progress track.

See page 40 for details.

“MARK PROGRESS TWICE”

When a move or asset ability prompts you to “mark progress twice,” mark  
double the number of ticks or boxes per the rank of the challenge. For  
example, marking progress twice on a troublesome challenge would  
mean marking 6 boxes (instead of 3). Marking progress twice on a epic  
challenge would result in 2 ticks (instead of 1).

Any additional instances of “mark progress” gained through an asset  
ability stack on top of this reward.

“MATCH”

A match occurs when you roll the same value on both challenge dice. If a  
move or ability prompts a specific result for a match, such as “on a match”  
or “on a strong hit with a match,” act on those instructions. If not, you can  
use the match as a trigger to introduce a twist or more dramatic outcome.  
See page 34 for details.

“ON A HIT” / “IF YOU SCORE A HIT”

Act on these instructions if you score a weak or strong hit on a move (your  
action score beats one or both of the challenge dice).

```
Troublesome
3 boxes
```

```
Dangerous
2 boxes
```

```
Formidable
1 box
```

```
Extreme
2 ticks
```

```
Epic
1 tick
```

390

#### “ON A MISS” / “IF YOU SCORE A MISS”

Act on these instructions if your action score does not beat (is not greater  
than) either of the challenge dice. Ties are always in the favor of the  
challenge dice.

“ON A STRONG HIT” / “IF YOU SCORE A STRONG HIT”

Act on these instructions if your action score beats (is greater than) both  
challenge dice.

“ON A WEAK HIT” / “IF YOU SCORE A WEAK HIT”

Act on these instructions if your action score beats (is greater than) one  
challenge die, but does not beat the other.

“PAY THE PRICE”

When you suffer a negative outcome on a move, you’ll often see a prompt  
to Pay the Price. This move helps you resolve the cost of that action. If  
you’re playing without a guide, you make the most obvious or interesting  
bad outcome happen based on the current circumstances, roll on the Pay  
the Price table to see what happens, or Ask the Oracle. If you’re playing  
with a guide, they can decide what happens, ask you to roll on a table, or  
talk it through with you.

“PRESET YOUR ACTION DIE”

Some asset abilities enable you to set your action die to an automatic value  
instead of rolling that die. If you take that option, roll only the challenge  
dice and use the preset value to determine your action score.

“PROGRESS MOVE”

This is a special type of move to resolve the outcome of a goal or challenge.  
When you make a progress move, tally the number of filled boxes on your  
progress track as your progress score. Only add fully filled boxes (those  
with four ticks). Then, roll your challenge dice, compare to your progress  
score, and resolve a strong hit, weak hit, or miss as normal.

You may not burn momentum on this roll, and you are not affected by  
negative momentum. In addition, assets abilities do not affect progress  
rolls unless they define a specific benefit for a progress move.

See page 42 for details.

“PROGRESS SCORE”

When making a progress move, tally the number of fully filled progress  
boxes (those with four ticks) in your progress track for that challenge. This  
is your progress score, and is used to resolve the move in place of an  
action score.

```
391
```

#### “REROLL”

After you roll your move, you may pick up and reroll the indicated dice. The  
move or ability will tell you what dice are eligible for the reroll; for example:  
“reroll your action die,” or “reroll any dice.” Unless stated otherwise, you  
may not reroll when making a progress move.

You may reroll only once, using a single throw for all dice you are rerolling.  
The new result for all dice must stand, even if it is a worse outcome than  
the original roll.

In rare cases, you might have multiple asset abilities that each allow a  
reroll on the same action. If so, you may make one reroll for every instance  
of a “reroll” prompt, following the process above.

Unless indicated, a reroll is never required. If you are happy with the first  
result, let it stand.

“RESET MOMENTUM”

After you burn momentum, or if prompted to “reset momentum” by a move  
or asset ability, you must adjust your momentum meter to its reset value.

The default momentum reset is +2, but this value is reduced when you  
suffer from an impact (page 50).

```
✴ If you have one impact marked, your momentum reset is +1.
✴ If you have more than one impact marked, your momentum reset is 0.
```

After you reset your momentum, resolve the move. If the move or an asset  
provides a momentum bonus as a reward for the move outcome, adjust  
the meter appropriately.

“ROLL +[STAT/METER/OTHER]”

This is the basic action roll. Most action rolls are made by adding the value  
of a stat to your action die. Moves may indicate a stat you should use, such  
as “roll +iron.” If it doesn’t, or gives you a choice, use the stat that best fits  
the situation and your approach.

Some moves and asset abilities will prompt you to use the value of a  
condition meter instead of a stat (for example, “roll +supply”). Others may  
include their own custom value or meter in place of a stat.

See page 32 for details.

“SACRIFICE RESOURCES (-X)”

Make the Sacrifice Resources move, suffering the indicated loss of supply.

“SUFFER -X”

Subtract this number from the indicated condition meter. For example,  
“suffer -1 supply” tells you to reduce your current supply meter value by 1.

392

#### “TAKE +X”

Add this number to the indicated meter. For example, “take +2 momentum”  
tells you to add 2 to your current momentum meter.

Your assets may offer additional bonuses for a move. Unless stated  
otherwise, this bonus is added to anything else you gain as a result of the  
action. If you take +2 momentum as part of a move, and you are aided by  
an asset that tells you to “take +1 momentum” on the same move, you gain  
a total of +3 momentum.

“WHEN YOU...”

This is a move trigger. When you do this thing, or encounter this situation,  
make the move.

Moves are player-facing. You or the guide don’t make moves for non-  
player characters or creatures. If you’re just checking to see if something  
happens or how someone acts, you can Ask the Oracle.

Asset abilities also use the “when you” trigger to give you additional  
options and bonuses when making a move. This might be a limited to a  
specific move (“When you Strike”), or can sometimes apply to any move  
that fits the scope of a situation (“When you make a move to...”). However,  
unless an asset specifically defines a benefit for a progress move, you  
may not leverage an asset ability when making one of those moves.

“WITHSTAND DAMAGE (-X)”

Make the Withstand Damage move, suffering the indicated amount of  
damage. This damage is applied to your vehicle’s integrity track.
