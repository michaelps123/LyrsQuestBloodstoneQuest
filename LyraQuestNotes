## World Truths:
### SUNDERING:  How did the isles earn their name?
- Strange technologies unleashed a reality-fracturing wave of cursed energy, forever reshaping the isles. 
- An ambitious few dabbled in ancient secrets, and in doing so, broke the 
bonds of reality. Strange energies flowed into our world, allowing uncanny 
phenomena to take hold. Science and magic took new forms. People and 
creatures of other realms were cast into our own like jetsam in a turbulent 
tide. The isles are forever altered by the curse of these chaotic realities.
- Quest Starter: An explorer brings news. They’ve located what they say is 
a nexus of chaotic energy. If it could be deactivated, the isles might find 
some measure of peace. Which power or foe seeks to harness this power 
to their own ends?

### RELICS:  What remains of lost or fallen people?
- Two centuries ago, a powerful empire dared to claim these isles as their own. Ruined places are all that remain to mark their hubris. 
- The tattered banners of the fallen empire lie amid ravaged fortresses, wrecked ships, and abandoned cities. In some places, nature reclaimed these sites. In others, people return to build anew upon the graves of these former invaders. Meanwhile, scavengers—like gulls picking at the bones of dead fish—scour the remnants in search of plunder. 
- Quest Starter: The emperor wore a crown adorned with two gems of unsurpassed size and quality: a blue diamond to honor Wraith, and a fiery ruby to represent Cinder. The resting place of the empe

### MODERN ERA:  What is the state of technology?
- It is an age of wonders.
- Some have wielded ancient secrets and extraordinary science to power vessels, weapons, and other machines. Their ships are fitted with energized sails that augment the powers of wind and storm. Their cannons unleash volleys of infernal energies. A few commanders even count iron automatons, given life by improbable technologies, among their crew. Resisting these wonders is like casting a stone again

### IRON VOWS:  What is the significance of iron and sworn vows?
- Since the distant time when iron was first hammered into form, seafaring folk of this world carried iron bondstones as sacred keepsakes.
- Each bondstone is unique—a relic of kin and culture—passed from one generation to the next. They are said to connect the soul of their keeper to their homeland or loved ones as if by an invisible thread. Thus, if lost at sea, our spirit may return home rather than remain entombed in the remorseless depths. We swear our vows upon bondstones as promises that follow us to our death—and beyond. But bondstones can also embody the curses of lost lives and forsaken vows, and bearing that weight can make them feel as heavy as a ship’s anchor.
- Quest Starter: A merciless and powerful raider wears the bondstones of their victims as trophies. One of those totems is rightfully yours. To whom did it previously belong?

### NAVIGATION:  How are people and places connected?
- We rely on the ancient traditions and knowledge of the Starmarked to navigate these perilous seas.
- The Starmarked have an uncanny sense of wind and tide, and bear the history of their travels as beautiful and intricate tattoos—etched in phosphorescent ink. Some of the places and passages pioneered by the Starmarked are now common knowledge, inscribed in charts and traveled widely. Others are coveted secrets, or lost to time and strife. The skills of the Starmarked make them highly valued as ship navigators, and some seek to exploit them to their own ends- Quest Starter: In recent years, many Starmarked have not returned from expeditions into a remote area of the isles. Is there someone—or something—that does not want to be found? 

### EMPIRES:  How great is the threat of colonization and conquest?
- Imperial forces vie for dominion over the Sundered Isles.
- Imperial colonization and exploitation is a creeping tide that threatens to engulf the isles. Colonial governors oversee ever-expanding settlements, while powerful trade companies control key trade routes and resources. Imperial agents conduct missions of subterfuge and assassination. Treaties between the empires are forged and broken on a whim, and mariners can never be certain of what flag will fly over a port from one day to the next.
- Quest Starter: Envoys and aristocrats gather for a gala at a governor’s manor house, where a priceless object will be on display as a demonstration of the governor’s power and wealth. If a clever thief were to abscond with that item, it would undermine the governor and foment suspicion among the attendees. What is this object?
	
### PIRACY:  What influence do pirates wield?
-  A burgeoning pirate nation wields great influence.
-  The marauder clans sail under the command of the Dread Court, a conclave of eight veteran pirates whose shrewd tactics positioned this nation of cutthroats as a rising power. Once each year, the pirate fleets gather at a port called Flotsam—an artificial island built from the husks of captured and ruined ships—to pay homage to the Court and make plans. 
- Quest Starter: There are schisms within the Dread Court. An assassination has tipped the latest gathering into chaos and threatens the future of this burgeoning power. Will you work to restore the alliance, or use the mayhem to your own advantage?

### RELIGION:  What is the role of faith?
- The gods enact their will through manifestations and miracles.
- We chronicle the visitations of the gods in our histories and decipher their enigmatic purpose through sacred rites. In times of crisis, their earthly avatars have guided us through the upheaval. For many, faith in these gods offers meaning and fulfillment. For others, belief is a cudgel used by tyrannical leaders to divide or control us. For this reason, some people and cultures disavow the gods to follow a different path.
- Quest Starter: You bear the mark of a god. The priests declare this as a sign you are chosen to fulfill a destiny. Do you accept this fate, and swear to see it through, or are you determined to see it undone? What force opposes you?


### MAGIC:  What is the impact of supernatural forces?
- Magic is an ever-present, elemental force. 
- Magic is as constant as the winds and tides. Talented mystics exploit these energies to shape natural forces, divine the past and the future, and cast boons and curses. A few can even breathe unnatural life into the dead. Many mystics join guilds or serve under mentors to hone their craft, while others make do with raw, untrained talent. In spite of their uncanny nature, mystics are often hired as aides for powerful leaders, or to help guide ships on perilous voyages. But as the winds and tides are fickle, so is magic, and some fall prey to the dark curse of these forces. 
- Quest Starter: Someone you love is corrupted by cursed powers, and is set on a destructive course of vengeance. What caused their fall? Do you seek to save them or defeat them?

### BEASTS:  What is the nature of extraordinary creatures?
-  Here, there be monsters.
-  We are trespassers in a cursed realm of beasts. Monstrous lizards stalk the inland wilds. Flying reptiles with wings the size of topsails dwell in cliffside nests. Giant sharks and serpents cruise the coastal waters in search of prey. The much-feared Kraken, larger than the greatest warship, lurks in fathomless depths. And some ancient beasts are too monstrous, too horrible, for even our worst imaginings.
- Quest Starter: Tales tell of the means of forming a bond with the mightiest of the world’s beasts, the Kraken. Many have undertaken this quest, but none have succeeded. What must you accomplish to gain an accord with the Kraken, and why would you face this trial?

### HORRORS:  What dreadful forces haunt the Sundered Isles?
- The damned and the dead are a plague upon the isles.
- We live in accursed times. The drowned and the buried do not rest. Tortured spirits hunt for retribution. Uncounted islands are blighted by dark forces. Cities and villages lie abandoned and forsaken, lost to a malevolent tide. We keep watch, craft wards, and offer prayers to keep the horrors at bay, but it is no use. They are coming.
- Quest Starter: For generations, an infamous ghost fleet has haunted these seas, sending countless mariners to their doom. Why do you now seek to form an alliance with the cursed commander of this fleet?

### Kieran Darkshadow

Kieran's existence becomes a cycle of excess and self-destruction. He uses his powers to pull off daring heists and escape impossible odds, but each victory leaves him weaker and more broken. His addiction spirals out of control, fueled by the agony of his transformations and the crushing guilt of his failures. As the shadows close in around him, Kieran realizes too late that the price of his ambition is higher than he ever imagined

Kieran was born into a small village tribe in the far south islands of Driftmorrow. When he was very young, the village was been taken by slavers. He was young and strong and fierce and was put into the fighting pits for several years. While there, he eventually met a shaman from a strange land who knew the craft of Starmarked skin writing. From him, Kieran obtained tattoos of power to heal, purge his body of poisons, increase endurance, etc. At first, it was to survive the pits, but as his skill and fame grew in the pits, so did the attention on him. A wealthy landowner named Lady Zira purchased him, his sister, and the shaman to work for her. Lady Zira at first just used him for sport in the pits and for her pleasures, but later came to understand his potential. She had him educated and trained him for other things; seduction, spycraft, and assassination. As his needs changed, so did his requests to the shaman. More tattoos for things like; more strange powers, and night vision. Each tattoo took a toll on his psyche and each use of them drove him to find ways to numb the pain and the unspeakable feelings it left him with. 
He eventually escaped this situation and blazed a trail through the known lands seeking to escape his self-inflicted curse. His sister, he vows to one day liberate her but knows that returning to lands where Lady Zira rules would mean her death.
