INTRODUCTION

A WORLD OF WOODEN SHIPS AND IRON SOULS  
**Sundered Isles is an expansion for the Ironsworn: Starforged tabletop roleplaying  
game. It offers guidelines, options, and tools for exploring a world of fantasy  
seafaring adventure using the Starforged system.**  
The Sundered Isles is a realm of wind and tide, mariners and marauders, rebels and  
empires, myths and magic. In pursuit of your sworn vows, you will chart a path through  
turbulent waters, venture across perilous island landscapes, delve into forsaken ruins  
and tide-swept caves, and visit far-flung communities. Over time, you will grow to  
command great ships and loyal crews, standing fast against dreadful and tyrannical  
forces that threaten to sweep like a maelstrom across these vast seas.

This is also a world of your own envisioning. At the start of your campaign, you decide  
the history of the Isles, the state of technology, the nature of supernatural forces, the  
dominance of imperial threats, and more. Your version of the isles might mirror our  
real-world age of sail, or a fantastic realm of wondrous machines, powerful magic,  
titanic beasts, and dreadful curses. You might even decide to set your sights beyond  
the sea, sailing among skybound isles or navigating the cosmic tides.

Once your world is forged, set your story in motion with a mission or imminent danger—  
your starting quest among the Sundered Isles. Then, play to see what happens.

CONTENT NOTE  
Sundered Isles includes themes of action-oriented violence, colonialism, warfare,  
natural disasters, resource scarcity, and supernatural horror. In addition, the random  
and abstract nature of oracle tables may prompt interpretations involving sensitive  
subjects that aren’t explicitly included in the game. Use of the included session moves  
(page 237) or your preferred safety tool is recommended.

WHAT YOU NEED

BOOKS  
The Sundered Isles Guidebook is used  
alongside the Ironsworn: Starforged  
rulebook, and assumes familiarity with  
the rules and materials in that book.

CHARACTER ASSET CARDS  
Sundered Isles offers an array of new  
character assets. You combine these  
asset cards with selected Starforged  
assets to create a curated Sundered  
Isles deck. Print-and-play asset cards  
for Sundered Isles and Starforged are  
available at ironswornrpg.com, or you  
can purchase preprinted decks. For  
dertails, see the asset guide on pages  
14 – 15.

### DICE

```
You need your standard Starforged dice
set—a pair of D10s for your challenge
dice, a D6 as your action die, and
(optionally) a pair of percentile D10s as
your oracle dice. When rolling on oracle
tables, an extra D10 of a special color
serves as the cursed die (page 114).
Also, some assets ask you to roll an
additional action or challenge die, so it’s
handy to have extras in your kit.
PLAYKIT
The Sundered Isles Playkit includes
character sheets, worksheets, and
reference sheets. Download it at

## ADVENTURES

# AMONG THE

## THE SETTING

Your adventures are set within the Sundered Isles. This is a vast realm of scattered  
islands and islets within equatorial seas. It is a long voyage to the isles from a  
continental domain on the other side of the world.

It is an age of sail. Mighty ships conduct exploration, transport, trade, and war. Your  
own ship is an essential aspect of your character and their quest-driven exploits.

FEATURES OF THE ISLES  
In the campaign launch exercises starting on page 66, you decide the truths of your  
island realm. To start, here are some default touchstones.

UNCOUNTABLE ISLANDS  
Thousands upon thousands of islands are spread out across these seas. Many are lush,  
holding their mysteries within the shadows of jungles or amid the tangle of swamps.  
Some sit within rain shadows or lie at the mercy of prevailing winds that leave them  
barren. Others are scarred by storms, volcanic forces, or the ravages of despoilers.

DIVERSE PEOPLE  
Many isles are inhabited. Some folk have lived among them for ages, while others  
are refugees cast upon the shores like flotsam from distant lands. And some are  
opportunists or agents of continental empires who seek to exploit the Sundered Isles  
for power or riches.

PERILOUS SEAS  
Sailing among the isles presents many risks. Mariners face unpredictable storms and  
dramatic tides. Rocky islets, numerous as stars in the sky, force careful maneuvering.  
Catching sight of another ship’s sails is not always welcome, as foes often outnumber  
friends in these waters. Some even tell of seagoing beasts and dreaded ghost ships.  
Despite these dangers, many follow a time-honored seafaring tradition. To them, the  
sea is not forbidding or mysterious; it is as much a home as their island settlements.

MIGHTY SHIPS  
You and other seafarers navigate the isles in sailing ships. These vessels, often bristling  
with cannons, are the pinnacle of the shipwright’s craft. But even the greateest of  
ships is vulnerable. Commanders and crews must keep a weather eye for the threats  
that prowl these waters—be it marauders or monsters.

CLASHING FACTIONS  
The isles bear the scars of a long history of disaster and strife. Recently, conflicts have  
reached a fever pitch as opposing factions conduct campaigns of espionage and open  
warfare. Foremost is the struggle against the tyranny of imperial powers.

6 ADVENTURES AMONG THE ISLES

THE MOONS AND THE TIDES  
Two moons—Cinder and Wraith—hang over the world of the Sundered Isles. Cinder  
is the red of cooling flames. Wraith is silver-blue. The intricate dance of the moons  
creates tides that vary dramatically by hour, day, and season. These tides are the  
rhythm of the isles, but it is a complex and discordant beat. Skilled mariners learn to  
anticipate and adapt to these forces. The unlucky and careless find themselves amid  
rocky shallows or struggling against fierce currents.  
Islanders divine omens from which moon rises or sets first, or which is shining and  
which is shadowed, but seldom agree on the meanings of those signs. Some favor  
Cinder’s ruddy glow, while others prefer Wraith’s cold light. A few see cloudy and  
moonless nights as a blessing—a chance to escape Cinder and Wraith’s oppressive  
gaze—but many fear what lurks in the darkness.

### THE TWIN FATES

The people of the isles often refer to the moons as the Twin Fates. Want to give your  
playscape a thematic boost? Treat your challenge dice as manifestations of the Fates.  
Designate one D10 as Cinder, and the other as Wraith. Choose colors that evoke the  
light of each moon.  
When helpful, use these challenge dice to reveal the nature of a situation, either by  
adding nuance to a move result or as a standalone oracle. Let the higher of the two dice  
decide. Cinder is hot: aggressive, passionate, resolute, physical. Wraith is cool: careful,  
mysterious, cunning, unearthly. On a match, choose which has the most influence.  
To learn which moon the sky favors on a particular night, roll both dice. A low value on  
a moon’s die means it is shadowed or not visible. A high roll has it hanging brightly in  
the sky. 10 means it is full. Double full moons is a rare event, full of portent.

THE SETTING 7

REGIONS OF THE ISLES  
Even those who sail these seas have yet to learn their full extent. Charts, maps, logs,  
and ancestral knowledge form an elaborate jigsaw puzzle—and none possess all the  
pieces. Nevertheless, the folk of this realm divide the Sundered Isles broadly into  
three regions: the Myriads, the Margins, and the Reaches.

### MYRIADS

The weather is fair,  
often as not. Trade  
ships sail charted  
passages between  
bustling ports, while  
pirates, privateers,  
and wreckers hunt for  
easy prey.

### MARGINS

```
Greater distances
separate the islands
and settlements. The
weather is fickle.
Ships and crews must
rely on skill and good
fortune when sailing
these waters.
```

### REACHES

```
Here the weather
and seas are most
unpredictable, the
isles and people most
isolated, the mysteries
and dangers most
profound. But many
crave the freedom of
these far-flung seas.
```

Each region is separated from the next by wide stretches of fathomless, featureless  
sea—the Bounds. Between the Myriads and Margins lies the Lesser Bounds, while  
the Greater Bounds separate the Margins and the Reaches. Traversing the Bounds is  
a rite of passage for young mariners.

Learn more about navigating the isles on page 32.

FORGING YOUR VERSION OF THE ISLES  
Most of all, the Sundered Isles lie within a world of your own making. What is the state  
of technology? How significant is the threat of imperial powers? Is magic a force within  
this realm? Are great beasts myth or reality? Do cursed undead sail these waters? Use  
the guided exercises starting on page 74 to learn more about the isles and decide the  
cornerstones of the setting.  
Then, through the course of the story, you reveal new aspects of the world. You  
may even face revelations or discover contradictions that force you to revisit your  
commonly-understood truths, such as encountering undead foes you previously  
thought to be a myth or discovering wondrous, seemingly impossible technology.

EXPLORING A CURSED WORLD  
Sundered Isles introduces a tool to influence the presence of supernatural forces and  
locations in your world: the cursed die. This die, rolled alongside your oracle dice  
for certain tables, reveals uncanny and unsettling events, grim discoveries, strange  
locations, confounding technologies, and monstrous foes.

Learn more about the cursed die on page 114.

## YOUR CHARACTER

When you play within the world of the Sundered Isles, you explore the stories of  
resolute seafaring characters who set off in pursuit of their sworn vows. Sundered  
Isles offers an array of new character options, resources, and tips to help envision your  
perilous exploits beyond the far horizon.

CHARACTER PILLARS  
When you create your character in the campaign launch exercise (page 90), you  
envision your background. Are you a native of the isles? A refugee from faraway  
lands? An imperial deserter or insurgent? Whatever your backstory, there are three  
baseline assumptions.

### YOU ARE IRONSWORN

```
By tradition, honorbound folk of the isles bind their promises and
ambitions to iron vows. These vows are at the heart of your adventures,
a lodestar that guides your course. What will you sacrifice, what
hardships will you endure, to see them fulfilled?
```

### YOU ARE A SEAFARER

```
You might be a skilled, novice, or reluctant mariner, but your fate lies
among the winds and tide. When you launch your campaign, you can
start with your own ship to command, serve under the command of an
ally or NPC, or begin your story on the path to earn—or seize—a ship
of your own.
```

### YOU ARE A REBEL

```
You might be a pirate, an insurgent, or a spy. Or perhaps you simply
forge your own path outside the reach of authoritarian powers. No
matter your initial circumstances and goals, the clash between
freedom and oppression will eventually sweep you up like a surging
tide. You find no peace or compromise in the face of tyranny.
```

Your Sundered Isles character uses the standard Starforged stat array, momentum  
meter, and condition meters. There is one exception: if you command a ship, its hold  
serves as an extra supply meter for you and your allies. Learn more about the ship’s  
hold on page 26. Download the print-and-play Sundered Isles Playkit and asset  
cards at ironswornrpg.com—or check your favorite virtual tabletop (VTT) application  
for Sundered Isles content and compatibility.

10 ADVENTURES AMONG THE ISLES

CHARACTER ASSETS  
There are dozens of new options for your Sundered Isles characters. This includes:  
✴ Your command vehicle, a SAILING SHIP  
✴ Modules to upgrade and customize your ship, such as an ARMORED PROW,  
LUCKY FIGUREHEAD, and IMPROVED HOLD  
✴ Support Vehicles, including a LONGBOAT and DIVING BELL  
✴ A variety of character paths for the fantasy seafaring setting, such as DUELIST,  
MUSKETEER, PIRATE CAPTAIN, and SWASHBUCKLER  
✴ Helpful animal companions, including a JUNGLE CAT and PARROT, along with  
more wondrous companions such as a DRAGON and THE KRAKEN  
✴ Deeds to mark the evolution of your character’s legacy and nature among the isles,  
such as FLEET COMMANDER and UNDEAD  
Several of these assets represent your potential role as a ship commander. Learn more  
about ship and module assets on page 16, and explore assets for command and  
crews on page 22.

### BUILDING YOUR ASSET DECK

Your complete Sundered Isles asset deck includes new assets and a selection of core  
Starforged assets. During the character creation exercise, you customize which assets  
are available to you and your allies. For example, you might omit supernatural powers  
if magic is not a reality in your world.

The curated deck is a recommendation, not a mandate. Adjust as you like. Be mindful  
of potential overlap between assets, and work to ensure that you and your allies can  
rely on distinct resources, abilities, and roles.

WHO WILL YOU BE?  
**When you create your character in the campaign launch  
exercises (page 90), you select two path assets as the  
foundation of your character concept. When you start that  
exercise, use the asset guide on pages 14 – 15 to  
assemble your Sundered Isles asset deck.**

### MIXING AND MATCHING

```
If you use other Starforged assets
(not listed here), be mindful of
doubling up on roles or abilities.
Some Sundered Isles assets are
reimagined and renamed versions
of Starforged counterparts. For
example, PEDDLER replaces the
Starforged TRADER. The surest
course is to use the Sundered
Isles curated deck, but if you find
a better fit for your character or
setting elsewhere, you are free
to customize.
```

```
THE RULE OF 3
Assets are inherently flexible and
“stackable.” This means you might
encounter asset combinations
that make success a foregone
conclusion for a specific action.
On one hand, it’s satisfying to
be successful. You’ve worked
hard to acquire your assets, and
it’s time to reap the benefits.
On the other, frequent success
can drain the tension and drama
out of your story, and tallying
bonuses can take up valuable play
time. Plus, hyper-specialization
offers diminishing returns—both
narratively and mechanically.
To keep your Sundered Isles
adventures on a knife-edge of
danger and unpredictability, apply
these three simple guidelines:
Use abilities from no more
than 3 assets in a single
action, and select those
assets before rolling.
Take no more than +3 adds in
total from assets on a roll.
If these rules negatively affect
the fun or excitement of your
adventures, ignore them.

Some assets use supernatural or mythic
powers ( 4 ) or remarkable technologies
( 5 ). If your setting is grounded in a more
historical or gritty tone, you might prefer
to omit these assets from your deck.
Many assets ( 3 ) are suitable for both the
seafaring setting of Sundered Isles and
the default sci-fi setting of Starforged.
If you’re ready to take on the perils of
the Forge as a daring SWASHBUCKLER
or robotic CONSTRUCT, you’re all set.
You can also use assets such as CREW
COMMANDER and COHORT to help
depict the crew of a spacefaring vessel.

decks are also available for purchase.

YOUR CHARACTER 15

## YOUR SHIP

Ships of the isles range from single-masted cutters to fearsome multi-decked titans. A  
typical warship is detailed on pages 20 – 21 , and you can generate ship features  
using the Ship Oracles (page 132).

Imperial powers harness the might of these ships to gain dominion over the isles, but  
independent people, smugglers, free traders, pirates, and other powers helm their  
own vessels. You are among them, and the ship you command is more than a means  
of getting from one place to another. It is freedom. It is home.

The ships you sail and encounter should reflect the nature of your truths, which you  
select in the campaign launch exercises. By default, this is an age of sail. But the  
people of your setting might face an age of industrialization, with iron-hulled warships  
and submersibles stalking seagoing passages. You might set sail in skyships—or  
even into the great aetherial tides beyond your own world. Envision the ships of your  
version of the isles as mundane or as fantastic as you like.

DAMAGE AND REPAIR  
As in Starforged, your ship has a single status meter—its integrity. When a ship you  
command faces damage from an attack or hazard, make the Withstand Damage move  
to see how it fares. See page 206 in the Starforged rulebook for details.  
To get your ship seaworthy again, make the Repair move. This move applies if you  
conduct damage control in a crisis, make repairs while underway or at anchor, or  
commission repairs in port.

If you’d like some flavor for the nature of ship damage, especially when you face  
a hard hit or dramatic situation, check the Ship Damage table (page 233). If the  
problem isn’t dealt with, step up the severity. When you Repair, use the “repair any  
other component or device” option to fix critical damage to a part of your ship.

16 ADVENTURES AMONG THE ISLES

SHIP ASSETS  
As with core Starforged, your Sundered Isles asset deck includes ship-related asset  
categories: the command vehicle, modules, and support vehicles. In addition, you  
start your campaign with an incidental vehicle, the SAILING SHIP.

THE SAILING SHIP  
By default, you begin your adventures  
in command of an incidental vehicle, the  
SAILING SHIP. This ship is likely a perfectly  
seaworthy vessel, but it’s not truly yours.  
It is a waypoint in your character’s story, a  
transition to better things. Eventually, you  
find your way to your heart’s true desire,  
your FLAGSHIP (page 18).  
The SAILING SHIP is not a character asset.  
It is not purchased with experience, does  
not have upgradeable abilities, cannot be  
enhanced with modules, and is not marked  
as battered or cursed to offset potential  
destruction. It is provided as a card in  
the Sundered Isles asset deck for ease of  
reference, but the card is not necessary for  
play. You just need a place to track your  
ship’s integrity as you suffer damage and  
undertake repairs.

Because of the relative fragility of an  
incidental vehicle—both mechanically and narratively—you might find yourself losing  
one SAILING SHIP and claiming another through the course of your adventures. A  
SAILING SHIP can even come into play after you’ve earned your FLAGSHIP. You might  
take command of another ship for a specific mission, or find yourself with a new—but  
perhaps temporary—vessel if your FLAGSHIP is destroyed or lost. In other words, the  
SAILING SHIP is a tool to represent vessels with a limited role in your story, or as a  
stand-in for a ship yet to be upgraded to a command vehicle.

In the campaign launch exercises, you envision how you gained command of the  
SAILING SHIP and decide some aspects of its nature. If you want to portray a more  
seasoned commander, you have an option to instead begin with a FLAGSHIP.

```
●● Heavy^5 Integrity
●● Medium^4 Integrity
●● Light^3 Integrity
```

```
SAILING SHIP
NAME
```

```
5 4 3 2 1 0
```

```
When you gain command of this ship, envision
its nature and assign a max integrity (5, 4, or 3).
If this is your primary ship, it has up to 5 hold.
You and your allies use your hold value as supply
when taking action or suffering a cost related to
cargo and shipwide provisions.
```

```
The ship cannot be marked as battered or
cursed and cannot be enhanced with modules.
If it is destroyed, sunk, lost, abandoned, or
upgraded to FLAGSHIP status, discard this card.
```

```
INCIDENTAL VEHICLE
```

**An ally can also take a SAILING SHIP as their own command, serving as an escort for  
the FLAGSHIP or setting off on a secondary task. But this is best limited to unusual  
situations so you don’t spend the entirety of your campaign waving at each other  
from a distance. By default, you are fellow members of the command team on your  
ship. You can learn more about command and crews on page 22.**

YOUR SHIP 17

### YOUR FLAGSHIP

This is your Sundered Isles command  
vehicle, purchased with experience when you  
Advance. It might be gained as a gift from a  
patron, captured as a prize in battle, claimed  
as a salvaged wreck, or purchased with hard-  
won treasure. You might even promote your  
incidental vehicle to FLAGSHIP status, giving it  
more importance and capabilities in your story.

Your FLAGSHIP’s max integrity is 5, and it  
can be marked battered or cursed to avoid  
a potentially decisive roll on the Withstand  
Damage table. See page 51 in the Starforged  
rulebook to learn more about these debilities.  
To explore a typical FLAGSHIP of the isles, see  
pages 20 – 21.

**Do you command a speedy but undergunned sloop? A powerful frigate? An  
imposing multi-decked titan? All command vehicles have the same mechanical  
attributes, but the nature of your FLAGSHIP should affect the rank of challenges  
and how you interpret actions and outcomes. In addition, you can add modules to  
better represent the capabilities and quirks of your ship.**

```
COMMAND VEHICLE
FLAGSHIP
```

```
●● Your seagoing flagship is armed with cannons,
transports crew, cargo, and passengers,
and can equip support vehicle and module
assets. In addition, it has up to 5 hold that
acts as supply for you and your allies when
taking action or suffering a cost related to
shipwide gear and provisions.
●● When you Finish an Expedition (dangerous
or greater) on a seagoing journey and score
a hit, this expedition strengthened your ties
to your ship and crew. You and your allies
may mark 1 tick on your bonds legacy track.
●● You fly a distinctive flag. Envision its design.
Once per situation, when you hoist the
colors in a dramatic moment, you and your
allies take +1 momentum.

18 ADVENTURES AMONG THE ISLES

### MODULES

Modules are linked to your FLAGSHIP and  
offer additional options and advantages  
when sailing that ship.  
Your Sundered Isles asset deck includes  
an array of seafaring modules, from the  
mundane (an IMPROVED HOLD) to the  
fantastic (a SUBMERSIBLE MODE). A  
module can represent a feature gained  
during a refit in port, a modification made  
by you or your crew, or an aspect of your  
ship that you’ve learned to exploit.  
When you Withstand Damage and score a  
miss, you can mark a module as broken to  
offset further danger for your FLAGSHIP.  
Flip the card over to indicate its broken  
state. A broken module cannot be used  
until you successfully Repair it.

### SUPPORT VEHICLES

Support vehicles are secondary vehicles,  
generally carried and launched from your  
SAILING SHIP or FLAGSHIP.  
Your Sundered Isles asset deck includes  
four support vehicles: a LONGBOAT for  
going ashore or ferrying people or cargo  
from one ship to another, a DIVING BELL  
for exploring the depths, a wondrous  
FLYING MACHINE for aerial missions, and  
a CAPTAIN’S BOAT for arriving in style.

Each support vehicle has an integrity  
meter. When a support vehicle takes a hit  
or faces a damaging situation, Withstand  
Damage to see how it fares. As directed  
by that move, you can mark battered to  
avoid potential calamitous destruction.  
Make the Repair move to clear the

## COMMAND AND CREWS

If you are in command of a ship, you need a crew. If it’s a small ship, you can manage  
with a handful of crewmembers. But you likely need a crew of dozens or even hundreds  
for a larger vessel. Crewmembers work the rigging, man the cannons, undertake  
boarding actions, defend the decks, make repairs, keep watch, and help manage the  
routine necessities of life aboard ship.

However, the crew is not given mechanical detail. They are largely abstracted as part  
of your own actions and the inherent aspects of your ship.

YOUR SHIPBOARD ROLE  
If you play solo and have a ship, you are its captain. If you play with allies, one of you  
is the captain unless you envision a ship and culture with communal leadership. In  
any case, work to ensure the other characters have a say in the operation of the ship.  
Non-imperial vessels in the isles rarely adhere to a strict chain of command—there’s  
no need to fuss with military rank and discipline.  
Beyond the role of captain, you and your allies can take on fitting duties such as  
quartermaster, carpenter, gunner, surgeon, cook, musician, or navigator. In a more  
fantastic campaign, a character might serve as the ship’s soothsayer, dragon-wrangler,  
or ghost-hunter. But you are broadly capable, likely wearing a few hats for duties at  
sea and ashore, doing whatever needs to be done.

ENVISIONING THE CREW  
Most crewmembers go about their duties in the background, like extras in a movie.  
But some key sailors might come to the forefront of your story. If so, give them a name  
and envision a characteristic or two. For inspiration, use the Character Oracles (page  
186 ). Familiar characters add personality to the overall crew and create opportunities  
for your story. One or more of these might eventually gain a spotlight as a specialist  
with the COHORT asset (page 24).  
Keep in mind your crew’s mood and condition. Are you sailing with a full complement  
or have you suffered casualties? Are they happy and well-provisioned, or are there  
stirrings of discontent? Perhaps even a brewing mutiny? Notable events should  
influence the crew, creating opportunities and complications in your story and  
providing context for the rank of your challenges.

LEADING THE CREW  
The moves you make represent your individual exploits, but they also resolve actions  
taken by the crew and ship under your leadership. When you command, guide, or try  
to sway the crew in a risky or uncertain situation, make the appropriate move. Your  
approach, represented by your stats, is innately linked to the ship and crew.

```
You roll a miss as you Undertake an Expedition and find yourself in the path of
an approaching storm. You Face Danger +edge as your crew mans the sails and
the ship makes speed to escape.
```

CREW-RELATED ASSETS
Your Sundered Isles asset deck includes several assets to spotlight your skill and
notoriety as a leader, and your evolving relationship with your crew. They are CREW
COMMANDER, PIRATE CAPTAIN, COHORT, and FLEET COMMANDER. These assets
are useful in a Sundered Isles campaign or as part of a sci-fi Starforged campaign with
a crewed starship.
```

```
PATH
CREW
COMMANDER
```

```
6 5 4 3 2 1 0
```

```
●● You have 2 command; your max is 4. When
you or an ally make a move leading or aided
by the crew, you may (after rolling) suffer -1
command to improve a miss to a weak hit, or
a weak hit to a strong hit. When you Pay the
Price, you may suffer the cost as -1 command.
While at 0 command, this asset counts as
an impact. To bolster your crew, provide a
notable reward or respite, and roll +heart. On
a strong hit, take +4 command. On a weak
hit, take +2. On a miss, take +2 but envision
a threat to your crew or leadership.
●● Take +2 command; your max is now 6.
●● When your command is 0 and the situation
desperate, you may Compel your crew to
action; if you do, take +2 command on a hit.
```

### CREW COMMANDER

```
The CREW COMMANDER asset bolsters
your abilities as a leader while adding
mechanical and narrative detail to
interactions with the crew.
This path includes a condition meter,
your command. This represents crew
strength, loyalty, and morale. You start
with a maximum of 4 command, which
can be spent to improve the outcome of
your moves or offset costly outcomes. At 0
command, this asset counts as an impact.
Restore lost command by delivering
rewards to your crew, such as a significant
share of a treasure or a lengthy respite.
When you Advance and upgrade this path,
you can increase the maximum command,
boosting your leadership and the strength
and capabilities of the crew.
```

```
PIRATE CAPTAIN
When you take command of a pirate crew
or give focus to your career as a pirate,
the PIRATE CAPTAIN path offers boons
for hunting for and seizing prizes, sharing
the spoils to build rapport with your crew,
and using your riches or infamy to gain an
advantage when visiting ports.
```

**If you want to begin your adventures with  
a focus on command and crews, take an  
asset such as CREW COMMANDER as you  
create your character. If you’d prefer to  
grow into your role as a commander, add it  
to your kit when you Advance.**

```
PATH
PIRATE
CAPTAIN
●● When you seize a notable ship or treasure,
roll +wits. On a strong hit, take both, or choose

miss, choose one, but this prize also brings an
unexpected danger; Pay the Price.
✴ Build your fortune: Mark 1 tick on your
quests legacy track.
✴ Share the spoils: Mark 1 tick on your bonds
legacy track.
●● When you Set a Course for familiar hunting
grounds or to intercept a specific target, you
may reroll your action die if its value is less
than your ship’s integrity. When you Face
Danger by sailing an area in search of prey,
add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.
●● You may spend 1 experience to Sojourn with
an automatic strong hit. If you do, you and
your allies take one extra recovery move.
```

```
COMMAND AND CREWS 23

### COHORT

By default, connections are not a  
crewmember. They are notable NPCs  
whose lives occasionally intersect with  
your own, and are tethers to people and  
places beyond your ship. They might  
accompany you on a specific mission, but  
will soon part ways as your duties and  
ambitions take you on separate paths.  
However, the COHORT asset makes  
a connection part of your crew as a  
specialist. As with a standard connection,  
specialists provide bonuses when aiding  
you and your allies in actions specific to  
their role.

COHORT is a deed asset, purchased  
when you fulfill its condition—accepting an  
existing or new connection as a crewmate.  
Upgrade the asset to add additional  
specialists to your roster.

```
DEED
COHORT
Once you accept a connection
as a crewmate...
●● You gain a specialist. The specialist is part
of your crew, but is tracked as a connection
and provides benefits to you and your allies
per their role. When you Withstand Damage
and score a miss, or if you Pay the Price, you
may suffer the cost by noting the specialist
as out of action. An out of action specialist
provides no benefit. To restore a specialist to
duty, resolve the situation as appropriate to
the nature of the injury, trauma, or dispute.
●● Gain additional specialists by spending 1
experience to add a connection to your crew
as a specialist. Specialist bonuses may not be
stacked for a single action.
●● When you Secure an Advantage by
gathering your specialists to strategize or
problem-solve, you may reroll one die for
each participating specialist.
```

Like a standard connection, COHORT specialists have a role and a rank. When you  
Develop Your Relationship, mark progress on the connection’s progress track. When  
the relationship is ready to evolve, Forge a Bond. However, because a specialist is  
more accessible and active in your story, the benefits of the relationship can greatly  
outweigh other connections. To counter this, do the following:  
✴ Give specialists a role that is specific and evocative, rather than generic and  
broadly useful. Think of them as truly specialists, experts in a particular skill  
or craft. Sailor lacks flavor and offers boosts for nearly any seagoing action.  
Navigator is more specific, providing bonuses when undertaking seafaring  
expeditions. Starmarked Navigator adds setting flavor to the mix. Even better,  
take on specialists who might be able mariners and contribute as a crewmember,  
but whose roles don’t come into play every session. Ambassador, Archaeologist,  
Courtier, Naturalist, and Spy are interesting roles that don’t impact the routine  
challenges of sailing and fighting. Feel free to adjust an existing connection’s role  
for greater specificity or suitability when you bring them onboard as a specialist.  
✴ Evolve the relationship in rare and dramatic circumstances. While any  
meaningful interaction is an opportunity to Develop Your Relationship with a  
connection, you should save this move for significant events with a specialist.  
Closeness makes happenings in your story less consequential. Ask yourself: is this  
truly important—a milestone in our relationship? If so, Develop Your Relationship.  
How do you introduce a specialist? They can be an existing crewmember, a reoccurring  
connection, or someone you seek out as a new connection to serve a specific niche.

```
After another failed overland expedition, you decide an expert is needed,
so you Make a Connection to find a guide. You score a hit and bring this
new connection aboard as a member of your COHORT, setting their role as
Wilderness Scout.
```

24 ADVENTURES AMONG THE ISLES

### FLEET COMMANDER

Are you ready to sail with a fleet of ships  
at your back? FLEET COMMANDER is a  
deed asset, purchased when you gain a  
fleet through the course of your story and  
have at least 16 filled boxes across your  
legacy tracks. This is an evolution of your  
leadership late in your career—you are  
now a major player in the world.

Your fleet is tracked through a power  
condition meter. You begin with 4 power,  
which serves as your stat when performing  
fleetwide maneuvers or attacks. You lose  
power when you Pay the Price and suffer a  
cost to your fleet, such as taking casualties  
in a storm or battle, or facing dissent  
among your ships. To restore lost power,  
Sojourn and forego one of your recover  
moves; this represents spending time and  
resources to refit and recruit.

Your fleet affects your character’s influence and the challenges you face. Instead of  
running from a flotilla of powerful imperial warships, you can take them head-on. An  
epic sea beast is knocked down a rank or two. You can blockade ports and wield your  
fleet as a political cudgel.

But even when you have a fleet at your back, the focus of the story remains on you  
and your allies. In big, dramatic scenes involving your fleet, zoom in and out between  
fleetwide actions, your FLAGSHIP, and your personal exploits.

SHIP MODULES AND  
THE CREW

**Your** FLAGSHIP **modules can also reflect  
the talents and strength of your crew, or  
influence the state of the crew. If your  
ship is RIGGED FOR SPEED, the crew is  
skilled at adjusting the sails for maximum  
effect. An** IMPROVED SICK BAY **helps

mark the fleet as wrecked. To refit the fleet,  
Sojourn and forgo an automatic strong hit on  
a recover move to take +2 power; if the fleet  
is wrecked, first spend 2 experience to clear  
that status.  
●● Take +2 power and set your max power to 5.

distance, escape a threat, or maneuver for  
advantage, you may push the crew and your

rolling), reroll any dice and count a weak hit  
as a strong hit. Then, Withstand Damage (-2).  
COMMAND AND CREWS 25

## SUPPLY AT SEA

If you command a ship in the Sundered Isles, you have two types of supply. Each has  
a value of 0 to 5.  
Hold supply represents shipwide resources such as food and water, rum, gear and  
tools, weapons for the crew, ammo and powder for the cannons, oil for the lamps, and  
wood and sailcloth for repairs. It measures your level of readiness for seagoing journeys  
and naval combat, and your ability to keep the crew provisioned and equipped. If you  
find yourself commanding multiple ships, the single hold supply value measures your  
fleetwide readiness.  
Equipped supply represents readiness among you and your allies: gear, weapons  
and ammo, and provisions when going ashore. Think of it as your personal supply—  
the things you and your allies count among your equipment and belongings at hand.

Both values are shared between you and your allies. If you or an ally make a move  
to increase supply, or suffer the result of an outcome that reduces supply, everyone  
adjusts the appropriate meter on their character sheets.

MANAGING SUPPLY  
With a few exceptions, moves and assets don’t specifically reference your hold supply  
and equipped supply. Instead, as with core Starforged, they just refer to “supply.”  
When you make a move that prompts you to roll or add supply, or suffer a loss of  
supply, look to the fiction to decide if the action uses your hold supply or equipped  
supply. They should not be combined in the same move. Some examples:

Move Hold Supply Equipped Supply

Set a Course Sail along a known routein your ship^ Journey overland along a known path

Resupply Scavenge supplies froma wrecked ship^ Gather musket shot from a fallen foe

Check Your Gear Check the ship’s storesfor rum^ Check for a torch when delving a cave

Sacrifice Resources Expend cannon shot ina broadside volley^ Drop provisions while running from a jungle cat

A simpler way to think about it: the small-scale resources you and your allies carry  
are equipped supply, and the large-scale resources in your ship’s stores and armory  
are hold supply. You usually use your equipped supply to resolve actions and suffer  
outcomes when taking individual action, and your hold supply when taking shipwide  
actions. If unsure, use whichever favors you in that situation.

```
You and a party of crewmembers attack an enemy encampment, and are
victorious. You order the crew to seize the camp’s provisions, bolstering your
hold supply as you Resupply.
```

26 ADVENTURES AMONG THE ISLES

### TRACKING SUPPLY

Small wooden cubes—available in craft stores—are a pleasingly thematic way  
to measure your current hold supply, with each cube counting as one supply. Or  
download the illustrated Sundered Isles character sheet from ironswornrpg.com,  
which includes dedicated places for both supply values.

MARKING UNPREPARED  
Since hold supply and equipped supply are tracked separately, each has its potential  
to make you unprepared. If either meter falls to zero, suffer the unprepared impact. If  
both fall to zero, mark the second unprepared as an extra impact. You must Resupply  
to clear an unprepared impact, but clear only one instance of unprepared through a  
single Resupply action.  
If your ship is lost, your hold supply is lost along with it. You don’t mark unprepared,  
but you won’t have access to hold supply until you gain a new ship. If you transfer your  
command from one ship to another, keep your current hold supply.

CONNECTING SUPPLY TO THE FICTION  
Supply is mainly abstracted. You aren’t counting individual barrels of grog or musket  
shot. However, it’s useful to think in terms of specific resources affected. This helps  
you envision opportunities and perils with greater context. If you Sacrifice Resources,  
what do you lose or what shortfall is most pressing? If you Resupply, what do you gain?

```
You roll a miss as you Undertake an Expedition, and envision your ship stranded
amid stagnant winds and sweltering heat. You Sacrifice Resources as the last
of the fresh water is rationed out, reduce your hold supply to 0, and mark
unprepared. Once the wind returns, you’ll need to travel to one of the nearby
islands and go ashore to find a source of fresh water to Resupply.
```

### DRAWING EQUIPPED SUPPLY FROM HOLD SUPPLY

The Sundered Isles version of the Resupply move includes an option to “Gear up from  
your ship’s stores.” This represents drawing from your hold supply to bolster your  
equipped supply, such as readying your provisions for an overland trek, or procuring  
weapons and ammo from the ship’s armory. Following the move prompts, roll +supply  
(hold) and resolve the outcome as follows:  
✴ On a strong hit, take the boost to your equipped supply. Hold supply is unaffected.  
✴ On a weak hit, you gain equipped supply, but “you must first deal with a cost,  
complication, or demand.” The obvious cost is to Sacrifice Resources, suffering -1  
to your hold supply. You are draining one resource to bolster another.  
✴ On a miss, you don’t boost your equipped supply, and the situation worsens.  
Perhaps this wastes time or leaves you disadvantaged, and you Lose Momentum.  
Or you face an issue with your supply that creates a new complication.

**Hold supply is an extra resource to aid your actions and mitigate failure. To keep the  
pressure on, depict a dramatic world of struggle and scarcity. Let costly outcomes  
force you to Sacrifice Resources. Don’t go easy. Stay hungry.**

SUPPLY AT SEA 27

## WEALTH AND TREASURE

By default, gameplay in Starforged and Sundered Isles isn’t concerned with acquiring  
riches or counting coins. Money is—at most—a narrative means to an end. The  
economies of these worlds are largely built upon barter and favors, and your personal  
wherewithal is abstracted within your supply meters and the progression through your  
legacy tracks.

However, Sundered Isles adds crewed ships to the mix, and funding their upkeep can  
help drive challenges and opportunities in your story. What’s more, taking from those  
in power, bleeding the empires dry, redirecting those resources to your own ends—  
those pursuits are worth their weight in gold.

If you want to give the ebb and flow of wealth more focus in your campaign, use the  
optional guidelines detailed below.

MANAGING YOUR TREASURY  
Your treasury is a reserve of money, goods, and valuables. It is distinct from your  
personal supply and hold supply (page 26), which represent equipment and  
provisions on hand. It is used to maintain your crew and ship, make purchases, gain  
or grant favors, and pay off debts. The items in your treasury might be received as  
payment, found in the course of your adventures, or plundered from your foes.

The resources held in your treasury are inventoried in your ledger. The Sundered Isles  
Playkit, available for download at ironswornrpg.com, includes a ledger worksheet.

ACQUIRING WEALTH  
When you acquire something of worth—whether a stockpile of trade goods, a payment  
from a patron or benefactor, a chest filled with gold, or a captured ship—give it a value  
ranging from 1 to 5 points. See the table below for examples.

```
Value Examples
1 Mundane trade goods or supplies, routine payment, scavenged item, unremarkable relic
```

```
2 Valuable trade goods, reasonable payment, finely-crafted item, small cache of valuables, minor relic
```

```
3 Exceptional trade goods, generous payment, exceptional item, large cache of valuables, rare relic
```

```
4 Minor prize ship, excessive payment, masterwork item, impressive collection of valuables, precious relic
```

```
5 Major prize ship, huge payment, incomparable item, bountiful stockpile of valuables, wondrous relic
```

These values are abstracted. Five ledger items of 1 value do not necessarily equal a  
single item with a worth of 5, but can be treated that way for the sake of simplicity.

28 ADVENTURES AMONG THE ISLES

### SPENDING WEALTH

Exchange items or spend funds from your treasury as best fits the narrative. Dipping  
into your treasury doesn’t add mechanical bonuses to a move, nor is it (usually) an  
excuse to skip moves altogether. Any action that has you seeking resources, services,  
or favors from a character or organization is likely to carry a cost. For example:  
✴ You commission repairs at a dockyard; this allows you to select “At a Facility” when  
making the Repair move.  
✴ You hire a local guide to help show the way on an overland journey; this allows you  
to Set a Course instead of Undertake an Expedition when you set off.  
✴ While low on provisions, you encounter a friendly ship and offer to swap the trade  
goods in your hold for food and fresh water; this allows you to attempt a Resupply,  
✴ You want to make your FLAGSHIP more impressive, so you hire local artisans to  
outfit the ship with fine fittings and furnishings; this—along with spent experience—  
allows you to gain the GILDED ADORNMENTS module asset as you Advance.  
The narrative framing helps determine if a move is necessary, what is required to  
make the move, and what you gain or lose. Does the context of the action and your  
approach require that you expend some wealth? If so, decide the cost and mark it off.

```
You arrive at an imperial port with a hold full of smuggled weapons, ready for
delivery to an underground resistance group. However, you must first avoid
the attention of port officials. You visit the harbor master’s office, a pouch of
flawless pearls in hand (value 2), and Compel them to look the other way as
you offload the armaments.
```

When money is involved, your treasury can also help resolve a costly outcome.

```
You score a weak hit as you make your offer to the harbor master. Per the
outcome of that move, “their agreement comes with a demand or complication.”
It seems the official is not satisfied with the bribe. Luckily you came prepared
and sweeten the pot with a weighty bag of coin (value 2).
```

### UPDATING YOUR LEDGER

Record new acquisitions in your ledger. Each row of the ledger includes five circles.  
Note an item’s value by marking a **+** symbol in those circles—one marked circle for  
each point of value. When you spend or sacrifice value from your treasury, fill in the  
circle to represent what was lost. When an item is fully spent, draw a line through its  
entry or put a checkmark or X in the box beside it.

```
Coffee
Payment in coin for passage to Dagger Isle
Prize ship (The Tide Chaser)
Strongbox full of rubies
```

WEALTH AND TREASURE 29

### CONVERTING WEALTH

Readily spendable valuables such as coins, stockpiles of trade goods, or stacks of  
metal ingots are often used piecemeal. For example, if you receive a payment of value  
3 in coinage, it’s a simple matter to spend 1 portion of this ledger item, reducing its  
value to 2. However, other items aren’t so easily dealt with in increments.

If you have an opportunity to convert an item in your ledger to a more readily-  
spendable or tradeable resource, clear the old entry and add a new one. In typical  
cases, you should make the value of the new item one step lower (minimum 1) to  
reflect the inherent cost of the exchange.

```
You visit a port city with a war prize, a captured frigate, in tow. You offload the
value 4 vessel to a black market shipbroker, and add a new entry (“coin paid for
captured frigate”) to your ledger, giving it a value of 3.
```

Not all resources are in demand in all places. An inland village has little need of a ship.  
A rare curio may require a very particular buyer. If you’re not sure if a ledger item is  
spendable or exchangeable at a specific location, Ask the Oracle.

WANT SOMETHING SIMPLER?  
If you prefer not to fuss with individual items in a ledger, you can keep a running total  
for your treasury. When you claim an item, add its value to the total. When you spend,  
barter, or sacrifice a portion of your treasury, reduce your total. Alternatively, you can  
treat any readily spendable resources such as coins as a lump sum, and save the  
ledger for unique items of note.

DEALING WITH UPKEEP  
Your upkeep is an ongoing cost for maintaining your ships and outfitting your crew.

SETTING YOUR UPKEEP  
Based on the size of your ship or fleet, use the  
table shown here to set your base upkeep. If  
any unusual aspects of your holdings make your  
upkeep more expensive, increase this cost by  
a point or two. For example, if you add a pricey  
specialist aboard your small ship, make your  
upkeep 2 instead of 1. There is a spot on your  
ledger to record your current upkeep.

PAYING UPKEEP  
Upkeep is typically spent as you Sojourn, and covers the other moves you make  
during the layover to rest and refit. You can also consider your upkeep as the base  
cost for periodic shares to your crew. Anytime you seek to reward those under your  
command or gain favor, mark off the cost in upkeep. If you cannot pay upkeep, your  
crew will grow discontent and your ship will fall out of repair. You need to seek out  
the means of bolstering your treasury—take a job, chase down rumors of a hidden  
treasure, or plunder fat imperial targets.

```
Upkeep Example
1 Small ship
2 Medium ship
3 Large ship
4 Colossal ship or flotilla
5 Fleet of ships
```

30 ADVENTURES AMONG THE ISLES

MORE MONEY, MORE PROBLEMS?  
At the start of the campaign, you are likely an upstart character scrambling to survive.  
Your sworn quests are the focus, but financial resources are an unfortunate aspect of  
keeping your ship afloat and crew paid.  
However, once you gain a modicum of wealth and influence, your focus may shift  
from the grind of subsistence to larger concerns. If your treasury and ledger feel like a  
foregone conclusion—unnecessary busywork—then you are ready to move on. It’s no  
longer a question of whether you can afford a bribe for the harbormaster, but whether  
that bribe goes unnoticed or causes new troubles.

In particular, acquiring a large treasure hoard or wondrous artifact can upend your  
campaign. How do you keep it a secret? What other people and factions are hunting  
for it? How will you use it to serve your iron vows? Let the discovery drive new  
opportunities and complications in your story.

THE LURE OF TREASURE  
There are treasures among the isles: coins of gold and silver, glittering gems, lustrous  
pearls, masterwork crafts, and ancient artifacts.  
Many of these treasures originate from the distant continental domain. Over decades,  
as wars and calamities swept over those lands, riches were taken as spoils, smuggled  
out amidst coups or rebellions, or greedily hoarded by imperial powers. These  
treasures followed various paths of fortune and misfortune as they made their way  
to the isles—taken and retaken in war, squirreled away in vaults, captured by pirates,  
buried in hidden places, or sunk to the depths. Much of the wealth of this golden  
exodus is still out there—waiting to be reclaimed or seized.

Other treasures are born of the isles. They are crafted or gathered by far-flung people  
or retrieved from ancient places. The treasures of ancient civilizations are sometimes  
claimed by the true inheritors of those fortunes, but are more often stolen by imperial  
powers and other looters.

REVEALING TREASURES  
Searching for a fabled treasure or capturing a powerful treasure ship can serve as the  
object of a quest. You can also discover treasures as prompted by an oracle table,  
such as among the cargo of a captured ship (page 139). To reveal the contents and  
nature of a treasure, use the Treasure Oracles (page 220).

A relatively mundane discovery can temporarily bolster your treasury, while a  
significant haul can change the course of your adventures—for better or worse.

CURSED RICHES  
Greed is a corrupting force, and not all treasures bring good fortune. Your cursed die  
(page 114) can reveal uncanny aspects of a treasure. Some riches are corrupted by  
foul magic. Others are bound to dreadful hauntings. The consuming lust for treasure  
has seen people broken, ships and crews lost to the depths—even entire nations  
condemned to ruin. Be wary of the allure of riches, lest you find yourself on that same  
doomed course.

WEALTH AND TREASURE 31

## NAVIGATING THE ISLES

Perilous journeys within the isles–whether by sea or overland–are managed through  
exploration moves (page 242). Below are some setting assumptions to help add  
flavor and context to those moves. See page 168 in the Starforged rulebook for  
additional guidance on travel and exploration.

TRAVELING BY SEA  
When sailing among the isles, you don’t simply unfurl the sails and set a constant  
heading to your destination. A voyage of twenty leagues as the gull flies is likely twice  
that distance along a meandering route. Abundant tiny islets, often uncharted, stand  
in your path. The push and pull of the two moons cause severe, erratic tides, and hull-  
breaching rocks and reefs lurk in shallow waters. The wind and weather can change in  
minutes. A sail sighted on the horizon might be friend or foe.

Within the Myriads, routes with reliably deep water and charted obstacles allow for  
predictable passages from one port to another–although those routes can change  
with the vagaries of time and tide. In the Margins and Reaches, reliable passages are  
often unmapped or known only to a few.

When preparing to set sail, consider the context of these setting assumptions and the  
nature of your voyage. Have you traveled this route before? Do you have charts or  
another character to guide you? What are the potential dangers?  
✴ **If your destination is a short distance across safe waters** , don’t make a move.  
✴ **If you know the way, but the voyage entails uncertainty or risk** , Set a Course to  
see what happens with a single roll.  
✴ **If you must find your way across perilous waters** , set a rank for the voyage and  
roll to Undertake an Expedition for each segment of travel. When your destination  
is in sight, Finish the Expedition.

32 ADVENTURES AMONG THE ISLES

### CROSSING THE BOUNDS

Each region (page 8) is separated from the next by a stretch of deep, open water.  
The Lesser Bounds separate the Myriads from the Margins, and the Greater Bounds  
are between the Margins and the Reaches.  
Without the aid of landmarks, mariners crossing either of the Bounds must rely on  
navigational skills and careful tacking for winds and currents. Perhaps most critical  
is the state of the ship’s hold, since you’ll be days or even weeks at sea without an  
opportunity to resupply.  
Resolve a crossing using the Set a Course move. Envision the journey, the dizzying  
open horizon, the long wait for the appearance of land in the distance. If you roll a  
miss, per the move’s outcome, “you are waylaid by a significant threat, and must Pay  
the Price.” Envision what happens and what you do to overcome the obstacle.  
If the Bounds is part of a longer journey, bookend the crossing with expeditions. Set  
your destination for the first expedition to Bound’s edge, or to a port that serves as a  
last stop. Then Set a Course for the crossing. Begin the next expedition as you reach  
the other edge of the Bounds and arrive in the new region.

TRAVELING BY LAND  
Whether you’re gathering provisions, following the breadcrumbs of a quest, or simply  
making your way from point A to point B, your adventures will eventually send you on  
an overland journey.  
As with a seagoing voyage, you have options for resolving overland travel. Consider  
the situation and the amount of focus you want to give this aspect of your adventure.  
Are you setting off along a well-trod road connecting two settlements? No move is  
necessary unless you’re facing a danger or complication. Are you heading upriver  
on a risky journey to a known inland settlement? Set a Course. Are you striking out  
into unfamiliar wilderness on a remote island? That’s a perfect excuse to give this  
adventure some focus as you Undertake an Expedition.

If you’re not sure, Ask the Oracle. The Island Oracles (page 142) can help as you  
envision the size, landscape, and habitation of an island.

NAVIGATING THE ISLES 33

CHARTING YOUR COURSE  
Some seafarers rely on memory and intuition. Others keep detailed logs and cryptic  
charts replete with headings, soundings, tidal readings, landmarks, and hazards.  
Like those mariners, you choose how to chronicle your adventures. Want to immerse  
yourself? Create an in-character ship’s log and detailed maps. Would you rather focus  
on the moment-to-moment story? Just keep a few hasty notes. There’s no wrong  
answer. If you’re having fun and the info you need is at-hand, you’re doing it right.

If you want to chart your travels, a suggestion: the seas are vast, and it helps to zoom  
in and focus by creating a navigation chart for a section of local seas and islands.  
These charts serve as a record of your adventures and discoveries among the isles,  
and help frame the complexity and danger of your journeys—whether you are sailing  
known or unknown waters.  
Much like a sector map in Starforged, a navigation chart offers a manageable scope,  
and can be as abstract as you like. For quickly-rendered maps, use circles or roughly  
sketched outlines for islands and simple notations for other features.

You’ll find a navigation chart worksheet as part of the Sundered Isles Playkit. It  
includes a space to draw your map, along with a faction influence grid (page 50).  
We’ll sketch out the beginnings of your first chart as you get your campaign underway  
in the next section (page 64). When you decide you’ve traveled beyond the  
boundaries of an area, it’s time for a fresh chart. As appropriate to your character’s  
familiarity with the area or access to existing charts, you might generate a few features  
to put on your chart as you sail into a new area, or find your way on a blank map. If  
you want inspiration for naming a local area within the isles, check the Local Seas  
table on page 227.

34 ADVENTURES AMONG THE ISLES

EXPEDITION WAYPOINTS  
The nature of travel within the isles lends itself to the cadence of Starforged expedition  
moves, with each segments of a journey separated by a waypoint. A waypoint is not  
necessarily a location. It can spotlight an event, encounter, or simply a moment of  
character interaction or introspection. At sea, you can envision finding safe anchorage  
to wait out weather and tide, creating an opportunity for a waypoint as a roleplaying  
interlude (page 46). On land, you and your fellow travelers take a break or make  
camp as appropriate.  
Use the Seafaring Waypoints table (page 120) to inspire situations and locations at  
sea. For an island expedition, look to Overland Waypoints (page 148).  
An important note: Roll for a waypoint only when you are inspired to inject uncertainty,  
danger, strangeness, or narrative potential into your story. Otherwise, simply envision  
the waypoint as appropriate to the current situation and the outcome of your move.

VISITING SETTLEMENTS  
A settlement is an island community—a village, town, or city. Some settlements have  
endured the test of time, standing as testaments to their peoples’ long history. Others  
are newly-founded, a footprint upon an uninhabited, forsaken, or occupied island. And  
some are captured as spoils of war, subjugated by enemies and empires. They range  
from small villages, to bustling port towns, to sprawling city-states.

Visiting a settlement might serve as a critical step in your pursuit of a quest, an  
opportunity to rest and refit through the Sojourn move, or an excuse to enjoy some  
low-key interactions with local folk. The Island Oracles (page 142) and Overland  
Waypoints table (page 148) can reveal settlements as expedition waypoints.

To envision the look and nature of a settlement, use the Settlement Oracles (page  
164 ). These details can drive opportunities, complications, and quests in your story.

NAVIGATING THE ISLES 35

## NAVAL ENCOUNTERS

Yours is not the only ship among the isles. A naval encounter is triggered when your  
intentions, the outcome of a move, or the result of an oracle roll reveal the presence  
of another ship or force at sea. For example:

✴ You roll on the Seafaring Waypoints table (page 120) as you arrive at an expedition  
waypoint, which randomly introduces a ship encounter.  
✴ You roll a miss as you Set a Course, and must Pay the Price. You resolve the cost by  
envisioning an encounter with an enemy ship en route.  
✴ Commanding your pirate ship, you Face Danger to stalk an imperial trade route in  
search of prey. You score a hit, and envision spotting sails on the horizon.  
This section guides you through the phases of a seagoing encounter: sighting,  
approach, engagement, and boarding. You use a combination of moves, oracles,  
and intuition to envision the nature of the situation. If you find yourself in a fight at sea,  
the combat moves help resolve your actions.

The procedures and tips in this section are geared toward ship-to-ship encounters and  
warfare, but also largely apply to other dangerous seagoing encounters. For example,  
you might assault a seaside fort or fight a titanic sea beast. Modify or ignore the phases  
as appropriate to the nature of your foe.

Most importantly, treat these as guidelines—not rules. It can be helpful to follow  
these phases strictly for your first encounter or two, but you’ll soon find your own  
preferences. Plus, different situations deserve different levels of detail. If it’s important  
or interesting, give it focus. If not, gloss over it and sail on.

See the next page for a summary of the phases. To dive into details, go to page 38.

```

### WHEN IT HAPPENS IN A BLUR...

When a hostile naval encounter isn’t worthy of resolving in detail, you can instead  
use the Battle move. Set your objective, decide your approach, and make the roll. You  
can also Battle to quickly decide how you fare against a secondary objective, such as  
when you deal with escort ships protecting your primary target.

NAVAL ENCOUNTERS 37

```
SIGHTING PHASE
Sails, ho! The sighting phase begins with initial contact. Use these
guidelines to help envision the nature of a naval encounter—
whether it be friend or foe—and to discover what happens next.
```

### ENVISION THE ENVIRONMENT

The time of day and weather can influence the nature of an encounter. Use the  
Weather Oracles (page 130) to randomly generate the starting situation, or simply  
decide what is expected, interesting, or dramatic  
Also, consider the state of the seas and surroundings. Most encounters likely occur  
in open water, but more complex terrain can create obstacles and opportunities. Are  
you sailing amid rocky shoals at low tide? Does a small island lie between you and the  
sighted ship? Are you navigating the foreboding tangle of a ship graveyard? Use the  
Sea Battle Features table on page 233 to add terrain and other aspects to the scene.

IDENTIFY THE SIGHTING  
Decide what you see through your spyglass using some combination of the following.  
✴ Check your faction influence grid (page 50) to decide what flag the ship or force  
is flying. Are they friend, foe, or neutral?  
✴ Ask a question using the Ask the Oracle table. For example, you might use the  
“pick two” option to ask, “Is this a pirate hunter or an imperial merchant ship?”  
✴ Use the Ship Oracles (page 132) to reveal details of the encounter.  
✴ Simply decide the nature of an encounter as appropriate to the situation.  
Mix and match these techniques as you like, and let the framing of the situation be  
your guide. A hostile encounter is likely if you rolled a miss on a preceding move,  
while a strong hit on that move can prompt a neutral or beneficial encounter. Most  
importantly, go with your gut. Don’t get mired in an endless series of oracle rolls.  
If foul conditions—darkness, fog, storms, or mystical effects—preclude a clear view  
of the other ship, limit what you learn at a distance. Will you sail closer to reveal their  
identity? Will they give you a choice in the matter?

SET YOUR ORIENTATION  
Is this sighting at a distance, or is it a sudden, unexpected encounter that has you  
in range of enemy guns? In ideal conditions, ships are first sighted as sails on the  
horizon, but weather, obscuring terrain, and the dreadful powers of supernatural foes  
can all have an influence. Let the nature of the conditions, the characteristics of the  
ships, and the outcome of the preceding move help dictate whether the start of the  
encounter favors you or has you scrambling to react. If unsure, Ask the Oracle.

ENVISION THE REACTION  
Finally, decide if and how the encounter proceeds. Does the other ship or force move  
to engage? Do they flee? Do they sail blissfully onwards, unaware or unconcerned? If  
unsure, Ask the Oracle. Then, decide how you respond. If either ship seeks to close on  
the other, begin the approach phase.

38 ADVENTURES AMONG THE ISLES

**Skip this phase if the encounter begins at cannon range. For example, if your enemy  
is lurking in a fog bank or approaches without warning under cover of darkness,  
you’ll jump to the engagement phase. You should also skip this phase if the outcome  
is not in doubt, such as when a superior foe is in pursuit of a much slower ship.**

```
APPROACH PHASE
Make full sail! In the approach phase, you and your potential
foes seek the advantage of wind and sea as you close into
cannon range or take part in a pursuit. This phase is a precursor
to combat, encompassing minutes, hours, or even days. It
is resolved through a single move or as a scene challenge.
```

```
RESOLVE AS A SINGLE MOVE
Face Danger or Secure an Advantage to zoom out and resolve this phase in a single
move. This is the suggested approach for most naval encounters. First, decide your
intent according to the details established in the sighting phase. Will you lay in wait,
close, pursue, or escape? Then, make the move to see what happens.
✴ Face Danger if your starting position is unfavorable—you are caught at anchor
and must hastily get underway, your ship is the lesser of the combatants, the wind
and weather is not on your side, shoals or reefs make navigation hazardous, or
some other complicating factor. You should also Face Danger if you seek to escape
notice or outrun a pursuing foe. This move tends to force a minor cost.
✴ Secure an Advantage if you are lying in wait, closing, or pursuing, and the starting
situation favors you. This move tends to award you with momentum.
If you are sailing with allies, everyone participates in the narration of the approach
phase, and one of you makes the move. Others may make the Aid Your Ally move to
bolster the leader’s action, but this is best limited to one or two allies.
Resolve the move as appropriate to the situation. If you intend to escape, you sail out
of reach on a hit. If you are in pursuit and score a hit, you have them in range. If the
two sides are closing to engage, success or failure helps decide the costs you suffer
or the advantages gained during this phase.
RESOLVE AS A SCENE CHALLENGE
If you want to give this phase more focus for an important or unusual encounter, you
can make it a scene challenge (page 254). This is best used when the situation
allows for a dramatic, dynamic scene. The framing and outcome of the challenge
depends on the intent of the two sides.
✴ If one side seeks to escape while the other is in pursuit, the result of the challenge
decides if the encounter moves to the next phase.
✴ If both sides are maneuvering into cannon range, the outcome of the challenge
can decide the rank for your initial objective when you Enter the Fray. For an evenly
matched encounter, formidable can serve as the default. If you succeed in the
scene challenge, you have the advantage—make your initial objective one rank
lower (dangerous). If you fail, make it one higher (extreme).
```

```
NAVAL ENCOUNTERS 39
```

```
ENGAGEMENT PHASE
Fire! In the engagement phase, combat begins as you and your
foes draw into weapons range. You are now bound to a world of
thundering cannons, billowing smoke, shattered wood, and torn
sails. You must rely on the strength of your ship, the skill of your
command, and the steadfastness of your crew to survive.
```

NAME YOUR ENGAGEMENT OBJECTIVE  
To start, Enter the Fray. Per that move, the first step is to set an objective. Your  
engagement objective is not necessarily your overall objective for the fight. Instead, it  
is an objective specific to the engagement phase as each side maneuvers and attacks  
to gain superiority or victory. Depending on the intent of you and your foes, this phase  
may bring a decisive finish to the fight, or lead to a boarding action in the next phase.  
Often, your engagement objective is one of the following:  
✴ Escape the fight  
✴ Destroy or sink your foe  
✴ Board the enemy ship  
If you have a higher level objective—a reason for this fight that goes beyond simply  
survival or victory—you likely set that as a new objective in the next phase as you  
board the enemy ship (or are boarded by them).

```
You engage Ember Rose, a warship captained by a mortal enemy. Your main
objective is to defeat that captain in single combat, but you must first endure a
fusillade of cannon fire and grapple the warship for boarding. For now, you set
your engagement objective: “Board Ember Rose.”
```

You can bundle multiple foes into a single objective, notching the challenge up a  
rank or two, or add additional objectives for noteworthy obstacles and goals. Does  
a blockade of ships stand between you and the flagship you seek to destroy? Make  
running the blockade its own objective. Is one of your allies determined to take out an  
enemy squad of marines by sniping from the crow’s nest, thus improving your chances  
when you board their ship? Set it as an objective for that character to pursue.

SET THE ENGAGEMENT OBJECTIVE RANKS  
Decide the challenge rank for each of your engagement objectives. As usual, your  
challenge rank determines the amount of ticks added or boxes filled as you mark  
progress during the fight. Formidable is a good baseline. If you are outgunned or  
outmatched, make it extreme. If you have clear superiority, make it dangerous. In  
situations of great disparity in power or abilities, make it troublesome or epic.

The objective rank should reflect not just the threat of your foe but the riskiness and  
complexity of the situation. If you find yourself in range of a mighty galleon’s cannons,  
escaping that enemy is a lower-ranked objective than sinking or boarding them—  
particularly if your ship has the advantage of speed or maneuverability.

40 ADVENTURES AMONG THE ISLES

### SET A TENSION CLOCK

A tension clock (page 238 of the Starforged rulebook) can stand for your enemy’s  
goal when they want to accomplish something other than sinking your ship. In many  
cases, this is the opposite of your objective. You want to escape the pirates, but they  
seek to board and capture your ship. You are chasing after an enemy, and they are  
making full sail to lose you in a fog bank.  
A tension clock can also represent a looming threat external to you and your foe.

```
As you square off against a pirate vessel, you see the water swirling beneath
both ships—a grim portent of a building danger. As you face costly outcomes
or waste time, you fill a segment of the clock to represent the expanding
maelstrom. When the clock fills, both ships are caught within its deadly pull!
```

Give the tension clock four segments for a typical fight, and six segments for a complex  
fight with a high-ranked objective or multiple objectives. If you can envision several  
opportunities for tension clocks, choose just one. Decide the most dramatic factor in  
the fight, make it a clock, and play to see what happens.

### SOUND THE ALARM

Beat to quarters! It’s time to roll some dice. Per the Enter the Fray move, you and your  
allies each roll a stat as appropriate to your actions and intent. Some examples:

✴ Motivate the crew with an inspiring speech: roll +heart  
✴ Take the wheel and bring the ship about: roll +edge  
✴ Lead the gun crew by setting the proper cannon elevation: roll +wits  
Your approach and stat choice as you Enter the Fray is often linked to the overall action  
taken by the ship and crew. If you are in command as your ship is lurking under cover  
of darkness or approaching an enemy under false colors, roll +shadow. If you hold fire  
until you come alongside your enemy, roll +iron. When playing with allies, the captain  
or character who is at the forefront of the situation can stand for this overall strategy.

NAVAL ENCOUNTERS 41

### ENVISION AND ACT

As the fight proceeds, envision the current situation and how you take action (if in  
control) or how you react to your opponent or other perils (if in a bad spot). In solo  
mode, your stats and moves cover your ship and your individual exploits, and you  
switch between those perspectives. When playing with allies, that framing may change  
from moment to moment as appropriate. But keep in mind that commanders of the isles  
are often people of action, as likely to take the wheel or hammer a plug into a leaking  
hull as they are to issue orders from the quarterdeck.  
Some broad actions and related moves are listed below, but these are not the totality  
of your options. Use the fury and chaos of the fight to introduce complications and  
opportunities. Envision the situation, decide your action, and make the move. Let the  
outcome feed into the framing of the next action for you and your allies. Make things  
happen. See the Starforged rulebook (pages 182–197) for combat move details.

42 ADVENTURES AMONG THE ISLES

### CONTROLLING THE WEATHER GAUGE

**In nautical terms, a fighting vessel that gains an advantageous position over  
another—generally upwind—is said to have the weather gauge. A ship with the  
weather gauge can better control the distance and orientation of the combatants,  
perhaps even bringing its guns to bear while denying their foes a line of fire.**

**The weather gauge can inform the fiction as you envision and resolve moves  
in the approach phase. Then, when maneuvering your ship in the engagement  
phase, you can think of your position—in control or in a bad spot—as a measure  
of the weather gauge. If you have the gauge, you can Gain Ground to gain  
advantage or line up a shot, and Strike from a superior position. If you lose the  
gauge, you have limited maneuverability and may be exposed to enemy fire,  
forcing you to React Under Fire or Clash.**

**This dance of wind and sail is only one aspect of the fight, but can help provide  
context and add a sense of seafaring authenticity to your actions.**

### MANAGE THE CHANGING TIDE OF BATTLE

Your fate in a fight is as capricious as the sea, and your objectives can change in  
the midst of the battle. For example, if your ship suffers grievous damage, you might  
decide your best course of action is to cut your losses. You would then Face Defeat on  
your original objective, setting a new objective to escape.  
Filling a tension clock can also trigger a dramatic change in the scene, forcing you to  
adapt your objectives and deal with new complications as the fight continues.

```
You are escorting a defenseless tradeship through a narrow strait known as
the Devil’s Spine. The channel is protected by an enemy fort that has you in
range of its cannons. You name your objective—Escape the Spine—and set a
tension clock to represent the tradeship’s seaworthiness. Unfortunately, the
tension clock is soon filled. The tradeship is crippled and sinking. You keep your
original objective, but add a new one that must be completed first: Evacuate
the Tradeship’s Crew. You also set a new tension clock to track the final fate of
the tradeship. Can you rescue the sailors before their ship sinks, all while facing
constant bombardment from the fort?
```

### RESOLVE THE ENGAGEMENT

This phase ends when all engagement objectives are resolved as you Face Defeat or  
Take Decisive Action. If the battle is done, decide your next steps. If either side sought  
to board the other and is successful, the fight continues in the next phase.

```
You set a tension clock for the pirates who seek to seize your ship. The clock is
filled during the fight, signaling that you are grappled. You must Face Defeat in
your objective to Escape the Pirates and muster your crew to repel boarders.
```

NAVAL ENCOUNTERS 43

```
BOARDING PHASE
Prepare for boarding! In the boarding phase, you and your crew
raid an enemy vessel or fort, or resist those who seek to claim
victory on the decks of your own ship. Armed with blade, musket,
and resolute spirit, you fight to seize your objectives.
```

### SET THE SCENE

Envision how the boarding action begins. In a ship-to-ship fight, boarding is  
accomplished by coming alongside the other ship, securing it with grappling hooks,  
and climbing over the gunwales or—for a more dramatic entrance—swinging across  
to land on the opponent’s deck. A boarding party can also use small boats to reach a  
disabled or unaware ship, tossing grappling hooks to climb up and begin the assault.  
In a fantastical campaign, boarding might begin with supernatural manifestations,  
aerial assaults, or raids by seaborne creatures.  
If your ship is boarded by the enemy, do you commit to the battle? If you surrender,  
envision how they respond. If they won’t accept your surrender without convincing or  
conceding, make the Compel move to see what happens. But if you intend to stand  
against them, you must again Enter the Fray. You made this move once already at the  
start of the engagement phase, but it’s time to clear the deck and set the context of  
the new scale and perspective.

NAME YOUR BOARDING OBJECTIVES  
If you achieved your objectives in the engagement phase, your boarding objective is  
your main goal for the fight—the task that set you against the enemy in the first place.

```
You seek the Golden Gyre, an ancient astrolabe said to guide its bearer to a
long-lost treasure. The Gyre is held by a notorious privateer whose flagship you
fought and successfully grappled. As you gather your boarding party, you set
your objective for this phase of the fight: Seize the Gyre.
```

If you must repel boarders as a consequence or cost of the engagement phase,  
consider what your enemy seeks. Do they want to seize your ship? Take your cargo?  
Capture an important person or object? Do you even know their purpose? Set your  
objective to oppose their own goal—or simply to resist or escape the boarding.

As with the engagement phase, you can set multiple objectives for complex and  
perilous situations, and an ally might have their own individual goal.

SET THE BOARDING OBJECTIVE RANKS  
Use formidable as your baseline challenge rank for your boarding objective, and  
adjust up or down to reflect circumstances.

If you inflicted heavy damage against the enemy in the engagement phase while  
sustaining few costs yourself, knock the rank down a peg. But if you suffered defeats  
and begin this phase at a disadvantage, increase the challenge. If unsure, choose two  
possible ranks, set the higher as likely, and Ask the Oracle.

44 ADVENTURES AMONG THE ISLES

### LEAP INTO ACTION

To set your position at the start of the scene, you and your allies roll to Enter the Fray.  
Decide your approach, make the roll, and put the fight in motion.

JOIN THE FIGHT  
Envision your actions and reactions, make moves when they are triggered, and use  
the outcomes of those moves to drive the opportunities, complications, and hardships  
you encounter. Envision yourself amid the chaos of the fight: volleys of musket fire,  
pitching decks, battle cries, desperate clashes of sword, axe, and cudgel—perhaps  
even fires, flooding, and falling rigging as one ship or another tears itself apart.

If you are playing with allies, you can work to achieve varying objectives or defend or  
attack different areas of either ship. Keep the spotlight moving between characters to  
give each their due. In solo mode, focus on your objectives and treat the larger battle  
as frenetic background detail. Tension clocks are a handy tool to manage aspects of  
a boarding action beyond your command or control, such as when your crew tries to  
hold back attackers while you are otherwise occupied.

Pile on the drama and intensity, zooming in to give focus to key moments. One  
technique for highlighting an important event or encounter is to create a new objective.  
For example, when you come up against an officer of the enemy ship and square  
off against them, set a new objective to win the duel. Much as side quests can add  
interesting twists and turns to your character’s larger story, a new objective in a fight  
builds danger and excitement.

END THE FIGHT  
When your last remaining objective is won or lost, the fight is done. What comes  
next? Were you victorious, advancing your goals and building your reputation? Was  
this a pyrrhic victory, forcing you to count the costs? Or were you soundly defeated—  
perhaps even facing the ultimate setback as your ship is sunk, wrecked, or seized?  
Let the fights’ aftermath expand like ripples to deepen your character’s story.

## INTERLUDES

Need a break from the perils of the isles? An interlude is a low-stakes, character-  
focused downtime scene. It is a chance to deepen your character’s personality,  
interests, and background—or add detail to the people and places of your world.  
Some examples:  
✴ Practice a trade or craft  
✴ Take in an awe-inspiring view  
✴ Join the crew in a raucous shanty  
✴ Partake in a drinking contest  
✴ Share a moment of intimacy  
Interludes help vary the pace of your sessions. They give your story and character time  
to breathe outside the pressure of risky actions and costly outcomes.

INTRODUCING AN INTERLUDE  
Interludes are flexible, player-driven devices. When there is a break from immediate  
pressure or danger in your story, and you are interested in focusing on your character  
or their relationships within a relatively risk-free framing, make it happen.  
When you Undertake an Expedition, the occasional interlude can help with envisioning  
how your character spends their time while traveling or during a lull at a waypoint. An  
interlude is directly prompted as a result on the Seafaring Waypoints (page 120)  
and Overland Waypoints (page 148) tables, but you’re free to simply introduce an  
interlude instead of rolling for a sighting or event on those tables.

ENVISIONING THE INTERLUDE  
Playing out an interlude can involve a quick, handwaved summary, or an extended bit  
of roleplay. The details of the activity or event are up to you. Is there an interesting  
member of the crew you’d like to learn more about? Does your character have a hobby  
or interest? Is this an opportunity to revisit a lingering rivalry or dispute?

If you want inspiration for the focus and nature of a scene, use the Interlude Scene  
table (page 228). Pick or roll on this table as you like.

### STARTING YOUR SESSION WITH AN INTERLUDE

**The Begin a Session move offers an option to explore a vignette—such as a flashback  
scene—that can serve as a character interlude. But the suggested prompts in that move  
often involve aspects of your campaign that are outside your character’s perspective.  
More importantly, Begin a Session is not triggered in the midst of a session, making it  
less useful as a narrative pressure valve during play. Use Begin a Session to put wind  
in the sails of your story as you sit down to play, and character interludes to add texture  
to your character and their world.**

46 ADVENTURES AMONG THE ISLES

MAKING MOVES DURING INTERLUDES  
Interludes are low-risk, low-stakes. You might trigger a move in the midst of an interlude  
scene—such as Hearten to boost your spirits in a moment of peace, Compel to defuse  
an argument among crewmembers, or Secure an Advantage to train or prepare—but  
the outcomes of those moves should reflect the low-key nature of the situation. If you  
have questions about an interaction or event, simply decide what happens or Ask the  
Oracle. If a situation is not dramatic or uncertain, don’t otherwise make a move.

Except in rare circumstances, perhaps a miss with a match, the outcome of a  
move during an interlude should not upend your quests, introduce dramatic new  
complications, or inflict harsh mechanical costs. Keep it low-key.

```
You envision an interlude as a sparring match between your character and
another crewmember—a talented fencer. You can simply decide how you fare in
the match, or you might focus not on the duel itself but on the flirtatious banter
(an all-too-common byproduct of swordfights). But you’d like to add some minor
risk and reward to the contest, so you frame it as an opportunity to improve
your skills and Secure an Advantage to see what happens. On a hit, you take
the momentum boost. On a miss, you suffer momentary embarrassment—and
dedicate yourself to doing better the next time you cross swords.
```

INTERLUDES WITH ALLIES  
Anyone at the table can suggest an interlude. When playing with allies, you can explore  
the relationships among your troupe of characters, or give focus to a specific character  
in key moments. Be mindful of rotating the spotlight.  
When initiating or playing out an interlude, check-in to ensure everyone is interested  
and invested in a scene. Adjust the pace—drawing out the scene or moving to wrap  
things up—as appropriate. Take a Break if needed, and use the transition to discuss  
what happens next.

INTERLUDES 47

## FACTIONS OF THE ISLES

You are not alone among the isles. Factions of all sorts go about their business in the  
background of your world. But the factions with the most focus are those that intersect  
with your character’s story. Which patrons task you with missions? Who do you count  
among your allies? Who are you sworn to resist? Use factions to reinforce the imagined  
reality of your setting, while focusing on those that generate opportunites and conflict  
in your story.

REVEALING FACTIONS  
As part of the campaign launch exercises in the next section, you introduce a handful  
of factions and define how they relate to each other and your character. Then, through  
the course of your story, new factions may emerge.  
When adding a faction or exploring the details of an existing faction, trust your narrative  
instincts. Look to the foundations of your imagined setting and inspiration from other  
media. Does it support the tones and themes you want to explore in your story? Does  
it add drama and conflict to your world? Does it connect to your character and other  
factions in interesting ways? If so, bring it to life.

If unsure about a specific detail of a faction, Ask the Oracle. But keep it simple. Leave  
aspects and mysteries to uncover, operating mainly from the limited perspective and  
knowledge of your character. If you want inspiration for factions, this book includes  
some helpful tools:

```
✴ Faction Oracles: Generate the details of a faction using the oracle tables starting
on page 176.
✴ Sample Factions: These faction summaries are organized in four categories:
societies (page 52), organizations (page 53), empires (page 54), and the
cursed (page 55). Your campaign won’t include every faction from these lists—
they are inspiration to pick, combine, or customize for your world. If you want to
put things in the hands of fate when introducing a new faction, select a category
and roll your oracle dice.
```

CREATING FACTION NOTES  
When introducing a faction, give  
it a name and a few details. Keep  
it simple, focusing on commonly  
understood aspects from your  
character’s perspective. Also mark  
down any key personalities and  
connections within that faction.

As new details arise in the course  
of your story, add them to your  
existing notes.

**Akiya SOCIETY**

**-** Alliance of island clans  
**-** Sails in sleek and speedy ships  
**-** Clans gather each year at the ebb

**-** Secretly aiding the Forsaken Fleet

48 ADVENTURES AMONG THE ISLES

THE FACES OF A FACTION  
Factions are more relatable when you give them personalities to ground your  
interactions, conflicts, and quests. For example:

✴ A smuggler supplies weapons to an insurgency; they task you with missions to  
steal guns and powder from imperial ships  
✴ A senior member of a mystic order seeks an apprentice; they train you in their  
sorcerous arts  
✴ A pirate leads their band of marauders in search of a hidden treasure; you hold a  
piece of the map that leads to that lost fortune  
✴ A necromancer is in command of an undead armada; you are sworn to defeat them  
Not every interaction with a faction involves a recognized person, but you should  
look for opportunities to use factions to enrich your cast of characters. In particular,  
connections—those characters whose relationship evolves through the connection  
moves—are an ideal tether to whatever faction they represent.

### DIVERSITY WITHIN FACTIONS

**The people of the isles—even among a shared identity or culture—are diverse.  
Not every person within a faction wants the same thing or adopts the same cultural  
influences. Among imperial powers, there are insurgents. Among religious people,  
there are doubters. Among warring cultures, there are those who crave peace. Use  
factions to reveal the broad strokes of influential people and powers, while leaving  
nuances to be uncovered.**

FACTIONS OF THE ISLES 49

FACTION PROJECTS  
As you undertake your sworn vows, the factions of the isles seek to advance their  
own agendas. To depict and resolve the objectives and actions of factions in the  
background of your campaign, use campaign clocks. You can create campaign clocks  
for faction goals, and set competing factions against each other with opposing clocks.

Your character’s aid or opposition can influence whether a project stalls or succeeds.  
But some clocks run independently of your own exploits, a ticking inevitably that can  
alter the future of the isles—it’s only a matter of when.

See page 235 in the Starforged rulebook for details on running campaign clocks. A  
campaign clock worksheet is included in the Starforged Playkit.

FACTION INFLUENCE GRID  
The navigation chart worksheet, available in the Sundered Isles Playkit, includes a  
faction influence grid. This tool can help manage the presence and control of factions  
in a local area.

When detailing or visiting a new area of the isles, consider the presence of known  
factions. Slot those factions into an appropriate field in the grid: dominant, established,  
subsisting, diminished, or obscure. The rankings represent the influence a faction  
wields and the potential frequency of encounters and interactions with representatives  
of that faction.

Leave a few fields blank. You may discover new factions or adjust a faction’s influence  
over time.

### USING THE GRID

Each field has a range corresponding to a result on an oracle roll. When you encounter  
a ship or settlement, you can roll on the grid to randomly reveal its controlling faction.  
You can also use the matrix when you Ask the Oracle about a situation, such as “Which  
faction carried out the attack on the settlement?” If a roll lands on a blank field, choose  
the closest-ranked faction, or use this as a prompt to introduce an independent group  
or new faction to your world.  
In addition, you can use the influence grid to track the ebb and flow of a faction’s  
power in an area. When a faction faces a major setback, reduce its rank. If it gains  
influence, raise the rank. You can even create a “global influence grid” to measure the  
power of key factions across the entirety of the isles.

50 ADVENTURES AMONG THE ISLES

FACTION RELATIONSHIP MAPS  
A relationship map can help you visualize the ecosystem of people and powers in  
your world, and prevent important factions from getting lost in the shuffle.

To make your relationship map, use shapes, connectors, and simple notes to illustrate  
the connections between factions. Different colors or symbols can provide an at-a-  
glance representation of broad relationships, such as hostility versus cooperation. In  
the example below, negative relationships are in red.

Put your character in the relationship map as well (and your allies, if playing with others).  
If you have a connection to a faction, include a broad summary of that relationship  
from your character’s perspective.  
Start simple, and leave plenty of space. You can return to the diagram to add details  
as the story and factions evolve.

**Periodically update your faction notes, campaign clocks, influence grids, and  
relationship maps to keep track of evolving faction dynamics and revealed truths. If  
you enjoy managing these details, this is a good exercise to undertake as you Begin  
a Session.**

**Over time, some factions rise to the fore, others fade into the background, and new  
factions come onto the scene. This is part of creating an emerging narrative and  
focusing on what’s important and interesting.**

**However, these are tools to use or ignore as you like. If you aren’t interested in  
faction details or campaign-level machinations, feel free to keep factions in the  
background of your story.**

## BEASTS OF THE ISLES

Here there be monsters. Within the isles, beasts are creatures of a fantastic or dreadful  
nature. Great sharks. Dragons. Sea serpents. The Kraken.  
You decide the nature of beasts in your world when you choose the truths of the  
setting. In a more fantastic and dangerous version of the isles, beasts roam freely.  
In a grounded campaign, beasts might be real-world creatures (such as whales,  
giant squids, large sharks, and crocodiles), the imaginings and exaggerations of  
superstitious mariners, or age-old myths.

INTRODUCING BEASTS TO YOUR WORLD  
The following pages include brief summaries of notable beasts in several environs:  
sea (pages 58 – 59 ), land (pages 60 – 61 ), shore and river (page 62), and  
sky (page 63). Use these beasts as inspiration for myths, dangers, denizens, or the  
focus of a quest. Feel free to pick from these lists, combine or customize, or roll for a  
random beast.

To unleash a truly aberrant creature upon your world, generate its form using  
the Starforged Creature oracles (page 336 of the Starforged rulebook).

56 ADVENTURES AMONG THE ISLES

THE MUNDANE AND THE MIRACULOUS  
As you travel the world, imagine a vibrant ecosystem with flora and fauna of all  
sorts. Oracle prompts such as Seafaring Details (page 122) and Overland Details  
(page 156) include encounters with mundane creatures, and other events such as  
interludes (page 46) may inspire you to reveal new aspects of the natural world.

Use these commonplace but memorable encounters to build contrasts with the truly  
unusual, wondrous, or horrific.

FACING TITANIC FOES  
The astounding scale and power of beasts can make encounters a daunting challenge.  
How do you stand against an epic beast larger than the mightiest warship?  
Your first and best option? Flee. But consider the flexibility of combat objectives. A  
single encounter can incorporate multiple lower-ranked objectives for the phases of a  
fight. For example, defeating a leviathan might involve separate objectives to lure the  
beast, slow or weaken it with tethered harpoons, and strike a deadly blow.  
Or Swear an Iron Vow and use that quest to track your ongoing struggle against a  
beast across days, weeks, or months. Each desperate fight is given an objective to  
achieve a small victory and Reach a Milestone, perhaps forcing the creature to slink  
away until your next meeting. These encounters build to a final dramatic confrontation  
where you—if the Fates allow—Fulfill Your Vow.

1–15 Predatory Shark Various Ranks
Most sharks offer little threat, but certain species of large, aggressive
sharks are properly feared and respected by seagoing folk. Mariners
also speak of ancient sharks, relentless hunters the size of whales
whose teeth splinter hull and bone alike.
16–30 Great Whale Various Ranks
The seas teem with whales of all sorts. Even the largest of them, the
great whales, are generally friendly and curious. They are nevertheless
under threat by whalers and despoilers, and some islanders sail in
defense of these gentle creatures.
31–35 Leviathan Epic
These ancient whales are far larger and more aggressive than their
common kin. Their bone-white hide bears the scars of harpoon strikes
and hard-won battles with other beasts. They are keenly intelligent,
have long memories, and do not forgive or forget.
36–40 Rothulk Extreme
Circling carrion birds and the stench of death often forewarn the
appearance of a rothulk, a cadaverous but still animate great whale.
These unfortunate beasts are infested by a multitude of parasites that
bind grasping tendrils to flesh and bone. The small creatures steal the
life of their host and puppeteer what remains.
41–45 Giant Squid Formidable
The largest of these creatures can easily crush a longboat with their
powerful tentacles, but they only reluctantly emerge from the lightless
depths that is their preferred hunting grounds.
46–50 The Kraken Epic
The Kraken is the singular master of the seas, a beast of horrific scale,
cunning, and ferocity. It has the sleek form and speed of a giant whale,
but is armed with powerful tentacles and a gaping, toothy maw. Along
its flank are rows of luminescent eyes; doom lights, mariners call them,
for they are a presage of certain death.
51–55 Sea Dragon Formidable
These aquatic dragons have glittering scales, toothy jaws, and long,
bladed tails. Their winglike fins propel them through the water at
amazing speeds, and send them leaping and gliding over the waves.
56–60 Elder Ray Extreme
Like their lesser brethren, these creatures have flattened bodies and
broad fins. They are inherently gentle, often traveling with seafolk who
recognize individual rays by their luminescent markings.

hound fishing boats in hopes of stealing their catch.
66–70 Eel Swarm Formidable
These masses of black-eyed, sharp-toothed eels rely on sheer numbers
to overwhelm larger prey. Some say they are capable of chewing
through a ship’s hull, and pour into a breached vessel in a slithering,
biting torrent.
71–75 Sea Serpent Epic
These titanic beasts have sinuous bodies, glittering scales, and spiny
red fins larger than the greatest mainsail. They are largely ambivalent
to the presence of most seagoing folk—all but the largest ship passes
beneath their notice.
76–80 Reefstrider Extreme
The shells of these gigantic, squat crustaceans are encrusted with coral
and sea life, camouflaging them among reef systems. They are territorial
and protective of their habitats.
81–85 Starlume Dangerous
Hundreds of pinpoint lights shimmer within the translucent form of these
gigantic jellyfish. According to legend, the lights of a starlume reveal
complex celestial maps. Those who look deeply into those alluring lights
may find themselves gifted—or cursed—with visions of lost seas and
hidden places.
86–90 Vortex Forge Epic
From a distance, this titanic entity might be mistaken for a great
whale, but it is a crewless metal construct that wanders the seas on an
inscrutable mission. Its rotating maw generates powerful whirlpools to
draw in prey, sending ship and sailor alike into an ever-burning furnace
deep within its mechanical gullet.
91–95 Herald Epic
These colossal tortoise-like beings are the longest-lived creatures of
the isles—perhaps as ancient as the world itself. Islanders interpret
wondrous and grim portents from the sighting of a herald, but these
creatures often go unseen; their craggy shell is easily mistaken for a
small, rocky island.

1–25 Predatory Big Cat Various Ranks
Big cats are the most common land predator in the isles. Some live
among the high branches of jungle canopies, climbing and leaping with
ease. Others dwell within the shadows of the forest floor or amid the
rocks and crags of highland terrain, stalking their prey with deadly skill.
26–35 Reaper Formidable
Reapers are bipedal, cunning reptiles who move in packs, striking
unseen from the shadows and chasing prey into flanking ambushes.
They dispatch their quarry with wicked, sickle-shaped claws.
36–40 Great Ape Epic
The towering great apes of the isles live in the most rugged and
remote jungles. They are reclusive creatures and do not abide rivals
or trespassers. Their long lives are marked by the innumerable scars of
fights with other beasts.
41–45 Thundermaw Extreme
This bipedal reptile is feared for its towering size, toothy maw, and
dreadful roar. A small circlet of bone rings the beast’s skull, leading
some to name the thundermaw a king among the isles. Despite its
legendary reputation, the thundermaw prefers to scavenge its meals,
and tires easily when giving chase.
46–50 Primordial Epic
This titanic, reptilian beast dwells within deep jungles and mountainous
highlands. It is a creature of the ancient world, unconcerned with the
petty affairs of island folk but protective of its mist-shrouded domain. It
is taller than the highest jungle canopy, and leaves trails of splintered
trees and sundered earth in its wake.
51–55 Avithor Dangerous
These person-sized, flightless birds are drawn to shiny things, and
collect bits of stone, metal, and trinkets in their nests. They are jealously
protective of this hoard. When a trespasser comes near, they use a
chittering call and display of colorful plumage to warn them away. If that
fails, their surprising jumping ability, razor-like claws, and sharp beak
make quick work of any threat.
56–60 Verdant Mammoth Extreme
These majestic, nomadic creatures have prehensile trunks, long tusks,
and spiraling horns. The largest and oldest of a herd, the matriarch, is
covered in a layer of moss, lichen, and plant sprigs—it wears this lush
garden like an elaborate, earthy cape. Birds roost along the matriarch’s
back and circle above while the herd travels, providing a squawking
alarm when danger is near.

61–65 Serrabrus Formidable
The serrabrus is a large boar-like beast. It is an industrious creature,
felling trees, gathering deadwood, and building crude barriers with
its sweeping, sawtooth tusks. To find oneself lost within the strange,
meandering fences of the serrabrus is to incite the rage of the builder.
66–70 Night Weaver Formidable
These enormous spiders have a sleek, obsidian exoskeleton and slender
legs tipped with razor-sharp hooks. They lurk in shadowy places—such
as grounded shipwrecks, deep caves, and dense woodlands—building
elaborate webs as traps for unwary prey.
71–75 Sylvan Strider Extreme
This gargantuan, insect-like creature moves through woodlands on
multi-jointed legs the size of tree trunks. It often stands perfectly still
while lying in wait for prey, indiscernible from the surrounding wilds.
76–80 Mimic Serpent Extreme
The scales of this massive, canopy-dwelling snake can shift in hue
and texture, allowing it to blend invisibly within its surroundings. After
grasping its unaware prey, the mimic serpent coils around its victim,
stealing air and crushing bones.
81–85 Ghost Rat Dangerous
These pale rats of unusual size are accustomed to life within lightless
caves. Ghost rats are blind, and use their keen sense of smell to navigate
the depths. They pursue potential meals with hound-like persistence.
86–90 Gangle Formidable
This large, cave-dwelling insect contorts its long limbs with uncanny
flexibility—the joints cracking like breaking bones—to navigate the
smallest crevices. These limbs, equipped with delicate sensory organs,
enable the creature to perceive the subtlest vibrations and detect prey
or threats from afar. After unfolding itself from its hiding place, the
gangle attacks with a spray of burning saliva.
91–95 Deep Dragon Epic
These ancient dragons lair in volcanic chambers, hibernating for
centuries amid superheated steam and gases. They are flightless, with
only vestigial wings, but their titanic scale and molten breath mark them
as the greatest of dragon-kind. The rare emergence of a deep dragon
from its burrow is a catastrophic reckoning for the surface world.

1–20 Great Crocodile Various Ranks
Large crocodiles dwell in waters throughout the isles, including coastal
wetlands, rivers, and the depths of tidal caves. The greatest and
fiercest of them are the size of a sloop —armed with dagger-like teeth,
impenetrable hides, and powerful tails capable of shattering stone.
21–35 Tenebrous Squid Extreme
This beast dwells within shoreline hollows and sea caves. It is a cunning
and patient creature, slumbering for months or years until hapless prey
wanders into its dark lair. As it awakens, its orb-like eyes glimmer with a
foul, hungry light, and its barbed tentacles prepare to strike.
36–50 Diving Spider Dangerous
These semi-aquatic arachnids trap air with their silk, enabling them to
hunt along riverbeds and coastal shallows, or lurk along the shore in
wait of prey. They occasionally get caught up in nets, an unlucky catch
for fisher folk.
51–65 Muck Toad Formidable
This creature lurks within the mire of swamps and muddy rivers. What
the muck toad lacks in speed and agility, it makes up for in strength and
scale, grasping prey with its prehensile tongue and swallowing it whole
with its cavernous maw.
66–75 Sand Dragon Formidable
Sand dragons are the smallest of dragon-kind, but are still a fearsome
foe. Burrowing beneath shoreline dunes, it stirs at the telltale vibrations
of footfalls upon its lair. It attacks with dagger-like claws, teeth as long
and wicked as cutlasses, and breath of scalding steam.
76–85 Keelback Crab Extreme
The keelback crab uses a scavenged ship as a protective shell for its
soft exoskeleton. Reports of ghost ships can often be attributed to
keelbacks, scuttling along coastal waters with wrecks on their backs. As
it grows, a keelback must commandeer vessels of increasing size.
86–95 Jade Crab Extreme
The jade crab is the largest and most aggressive of the crustaceans, able
to snap a longboat or even a small ship in two with its vice-like pincers.
At rest, their shell is slate gray, easily mistaken for rocks or reefs. On
the hunt, they shimmer with an iridescent blue-green. Fiercely territorial,
these creatures often claim a waterway, cove, or sea cave as their lair.

```
1–20 Great Hawk Various Ranks
Various types of enormous hawks hunt among the isles, including the
mangrove-dwelling ash hawk and the coastal wind reaver. The greatest
of them, the fabled vastwing, is said to be capable of grasping and lifting
a fully loaded longboat in its enormous talons.
21–35 Iron Dragon Extreme
The most common dragon of the isles, the iron dragon dwells in a
variety of environments, from rocky coasts to deep inland jungles. They
have a tough hide the color of weathered iron, dreadful claws, and a
long, powerful tail. But their most potent weapon is their fiery breath,
the bane of any wooden ship that earns their ire. Some island folk revere
these creatures. But others harness them and ride into battle, launching
from a seaside fort or a ship’s deck to lay waste to their enemies.
36–50 Wave Skimmer Formidable
These winged reptilian beasts nest along waterside cliffs, and are adept
at diving to spear fish with barbed beaks. Fishing boats and cargo ships
often fall prey to wave skimmer ambushes, as the cunning predators
have learned of the great bounties hidden within those vessels.
51–65 Goregull Dangerous
Scavengers by nature, the vulture-sized goregulls feed primarily on
dead sea life, but are known to harass the crews of floundering ships.
66–75 Monarch Bat Formidable
These oversized bats, large enough to carry off an unlucky islander,
dwell in caves and amid jungle canopies. As the sun sets, they leave
their roosts to hunt. They are particularly dangerous on moonless nights
when their swift, silent approach goes unnoticed.
76–85 Bloodmite Dangerous
Bloodmites are hound-sized, flying insects. They primarily cling to the
hide of titanic beasts, feeding through a blade-tipped proboscis, but are
not averse to preying upon smaller targets.
86–95 Thanatoi Dangerous
These moth-like creatures are unsettlingly large but harmless. They are
often seen on nights when Wraith is full—they shimmer with a strange,
ethereal glow, as if reflecting the light of the moon. Many islanders
believe they escort souls into the world beyond. Look too long into their
alluring glow, they say, and you suffer a glimpse of your own death.

## PREPARE TO SET SAIL

In this section, you forge a character and your unique vision for the Sundered Isles  
using a series of guided exercises. If you’re playing Sundered Isles with others, make  
this a group activity to give everyone a stake and input in the setting.

Remember: Prep is play. These exercises should be fun. If anything feels like work,  
skip it or take a shortcut and move on.

CONSIDER THE TONE FOR YOUR WORLD  
What sort of adventures do you want to undertake? Swashbuckling action? Treasure  
hunting? Scrappy, anti-imperial rebellions? Court espionage and intrigue? Spooky  
nautical exploration? Banishing eldritch horrors? Setting a baseline helps inform your  
choices in this section. If you’re playing with others, briefly talk it over.  
If you’re unsure, the decisions you make in these exercises set your course. But don’t  
let the exercises undermine your own preferences. This section gives you a true north,  
but you are at the helm. Steer the ship as you like.

BUILD A WORLD MINDFULLY  
Depending on your choices in these exercises, your version of the Sundered Isles might  
feature aspects of the real-world age of sail. In popular media, this “age of discovery”  
is often romanticized. In reality, it was a time of brutal conquest, exploitation, and  
enslavement perpetrated by colonial powers.  
However, this is your world. You are encouraged to emphasize fun and adventure, but  
should do so in a way that doesn’t reinforce the harmful ideologies and stereotypes of  
our own history. Consider the following:  
✴ Prioritize diversity. There are no setting assumptions that constrain your depiction  
of race, culture, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Envision a world  
of vibrant possibilities.  
✴ Reject the narratives used by colonizers to dehumanize indigenous people. Do  
not depict any indigenous culture of the isles as monolithic in their values or as  
universally good or evil. Do not portray them as inherently primitive, strange, or  
magical compared to “default” identities.  
✴ Resist injustice. If imperial forces have a role in your setting, they build their  
wealth, strength, and influence through exploitation and oppression. In their  
arrogance, they claim discovery and dominion over lands long-known and long-  
inhabited. Make no mistake —they are the enemy. Your character is not another  
cog in the colonial machine. You are meant to break the machine.  
✴ Carefully consider the representation of slavery in your campaign. The  
slave trade was an abhorrent reality of the colonial age, but is not assumed to  
be an aspect of the Sundered Isles. For you or another player, any depiction of  
slavery may be harmful or unwanted content. Discuss this in the context of your  
worldbuilding and Set a Flag as needed. If slavery is a reality in your setting, do  
not trivialize or romanticize it.

66 GETTING UNDERWAY

SUPPORT PLAYER SAFETY  
As you work through the campaign launch exercises and anytime during play, use the  
Set a Flag move to identify content boundaries and to prioritize player safety, comfort,  
and fun over the narrative. This can include content that will be omitted, modified, or  
addressed on a case-by-case basis if it is encountered in your game.

Work with other players to ensure a collaborative environment where everyone can  
Set a Flag. But keep in mind that using this move should not force a discussion of a  
content boundary. Players do not need to provide details or justification. If that is their  
wish, note the flagged content and move on.

### USING OTHER SAFETY TOOLS

You might find that the Starforged session moves don’t fit the needs of your table.  
Each person is unique in what safety tools work for them, and many other safety tools  
address this variety of needs.

You can explore resources like the TTRPG Safety Toolkit to find safety tools that work  
best for you and your game. The TTRPG Safety Toolkit, curated by Kienna Shaw and  
Lauren Bryant-Monk, is a compilation of safety tools designed by members of the  
tabletop roleplaying game community. You can find it here: bit.ly/ttrpgsafetytoolkit.

```
SET A FLAG
When you identify situations or topics you don’t want to include, don’t want to
envision in detail, or otherwise may need mindfulness when approaching, that
content is now flagged.
When you encounter content flagged as something to approach mindfully, pause
to consider or discuss its role in your story. When you come across flagged content
that you would rather adjust or omit, Change Your Fate.
```

WANT A QUICK START?  
**If you already have some idea of the setting, tone, and starting situations for your  
campaign, or if you are returning to an existing world, you can skip most of these  
exercises. Instead, do only the following:**  
✴ Create your character using the exercise starting on page 90.  
✴ Choose your command using the exercise starting on page 96.  
✴ Play! You can sort out the rest through the course of your story.

**Otherwise, if you are starting with a clean slate and want to set the stage for your  
adventures, turn to the next page to get started.**

PREPARE TO SET SAIL 67

```
GETTING STARTED
Work through the exercises below. This is a recommended order. If you’d
prefer a different order, such as building your character before generating
the details of your setting, adjust as you like.
```

1 Select Your Realm (Pick the overall setting for your campaign.page 69)^

2 Choose Your Truths (Decide what is true for your version of the Sundered Isles.page 76)^

3 Set Your Factions (Envision the influential powers of your world.page 88)^

4 Create Your Character (Set your character’s background, abilities, and characteristics.page 90)^

5 Take Command (Choose your role and decide the nature of your ship and crew.page 96)^

6 Chart Your Course (Create a map as a starting place for your adventures.page 100)^

7 Set the Scene (Get your story underway.page 108)^

```
A word of warning: You might find your creative batteries running low if you
pack the exercises into a single session. Consider breaking them into two
or three sessions—whatever works for your group.
```

68 GETTING UNDERWAY

## SELECT YOUR REALM

In this first exercise, you set the stage for your adventures by choosing a realm. Will  
you sail a perilous sea, navigate the lofty heights of a storm-wracked sky, or cruise  
among the stars?

Allow about 5–10 minutes for this exercise.  
The Seafaring Realm is the default. The setting truths, oracles, and character assets  
included with this supplement assume you are undertaking nautical adventures.

However, much of this is narrative texture that can be reenvisioned to better fit your  
preferred realm. “Sea” becomes a colloquial term to describe airborne or starborne  
passages. “Islands” are floating remnants of a shattered continent—or entire planets.  
You can focus on using the abstract, interpretative oracles instead of those that are  
more specific to the default setting. No matter your choice, you undertake adventures  
of sail and saber in a perilous age.

In short, for the most out-of-the-box Sundered Isles experience, choose the Seafaring  
Realm. If you are willing to make a creative leap of faith or have a specific setting in  
mind, the Starforged system is flexible enough to accommodate other adventures.  
Check the following pages for details on the realms. Scan or read those entries as you  
like to learn more about their features and default assumptions. Once you make your  
choice, continue to the next exercise on page 76.

THE SEAFARING REALM

In this realm, the Sundered Isles lie  
within vast and perilous seas.

No one knows the true extent of the isles. Untold  
numbers of them are scattered like broken shards  
across these equatorial waters.  
The isles are home to a diverse array of people,  
societies, and cultures. Some trace their lineage to  
the mariners who first sailed these waters in ages  
past; they mark their history not in the passage of  
years, but through the ebb and flow of the tides  
and the communal memories of the generations  
who came before. Others settled here in recent  
years as refugees or outcasts from distant lands.  
And some seek only to exploit the resources and  
people of the isles for their own ends.  
Seafarers who chart a course through the isles  
face unpredictable storms, fierce currents, shifting  
tides, shallow waters, and lurking marauders. For  
those who abide and understand the whims of  
the sea, this realm is home. Those who seek to  
control the sea, to gain mastery of it, find only a  
watery grave.

**This is the default when playing Sundered Isles. The oracles, new character assets,  
and other materials in this book are designed for this realm—but are often flexible  
enough to accommodate the other realms. Depending on the truths you select in  
the next exercise, your world can mirror our real-world age of sail, or spotlight more  
fantastical elements such as supernatural beings, steampunk-style technologies,  
and monstrous beasts. Your campaign might feature swashbuckling adventure, grim  
horror, desperate struggles against oppressive empires—or all the above!**

for the seafaring realm.**

THE SKYFARING REALM

In this realm, the Sundered Isles are the  
lofty fragments of a ruined continent.

In a time before memory, a massive continent  
broke apart in an earth-shattering cataclysm. The  
remnants of this land were cast into the skies,  
held aloft by unknowable forces.

Eons later, the floating isles beckoned with  
mysteries and an escape from earthbound war  
and strife, so explorers crafted airships and  
launched them into the storm-wracked skies. Over  
time, people and nations founded burgeoning  
ports among the aerial enclaves, but much  
remains unknown and uncharted. The islands are  
in near-constant motion within a vortex of wind  
and uncanny gravitational anomalies, making  
navigation difficult and unpredictable.

Island ecosystems vary by altitude. In the lower  
regions, rain-soaked islands are covered by  
impenetrable jungle. Higher, temperate forests  
and rocky plateaus are shrouded in cold mist. Still  
higher, some say, icebound islands are locked in  
an endless winter.

**When exploring the skyfaring realm, you interpret oracles and outcomes to fit the  
setting. For example, when generating a location using the Island Oracles, envision  
the results as the floating shard of a lost continent. In exchange for this leap of  
faith, this realm offers interesting possibilities for storytelling. What do settlements  
look like? What resources do the people trade? How are naval battles undertaken  
in three dimensions?**

**Ready to soar through the skies and battle marauders in the dark heart of a  
thundercloud? Launch your ship into the skyfaring realm.**

### FEATURES

✴ Airborne islands capped

✴ Waterfalls fall from broad

✴ Constant winds and

✴ Flocks of birds swirl

✴ Storm clouds unleash

THE STARFARING REALM

In this realm, the Sundered Isles are  
untold worlds adrift on aetherial tides.

The people of your homeworld once navigated  
the oceans, but now they sail a limitless new  
frontier. Mighty ships harness aetherial currents  
and leave shimmering waves of prismatic energy  
in their wake. An untold number of worlds—  
colloquially called Isles by your once-seafaring  
people—spin in their complex orbits within this  
starry expanse.

For bold sailors who set off into this realm, the  
aether is life. Its starborne currents bear ships and  
provide breathable air in an otherwise deadly void.  
But the aether is capricious and ever-changing;  
navigating its chaotic passages demands skill,  
courage, and luck in equal measure.

**The starfaring realm provides the greatest opportunity to freely mix-and-match your  
Starforged and Sundered Isles assets and oracles. Within this realm, you set a course  
for distant planets, navigate perilous asteroids fields, encounter extraordinary alien  
creatures—perhaps even delve ancient precursor vaults. As appropriate to the truths  
you select in the next exercise, your version of the setting might use technological  
Starforged assets re-themed as aether-powered technologies.**

**Ready to wade into battle in your ironclad exosuit armed with a blade of scintillating  
energy? The starfaring realm awaits.**

### FEATURES

✴ Life-giving starborne
currents
✴ Colorful clouds of cosmic
dust
✴ Countless planets and

✴ Aether ships gathering at
bustling space ports
✴ Unpredictable aether

✴ Strange creatures

## CHOOSE YOUR TRUTHS

In this exercise, you set the tone and background for your campaign by deciding the  
nature of your version of the Sundered Isles. These are your truths. When you’re done,  
you’ll have key aspects of your setting sketched out, and a backdrop of challenges to  
help fuel your adventures  
Allow about 30–45 minutes for this exercise.

recommended asset interests you, or a faction fits your vision for the world, make note  
of it. In the following two exercises, you introduce factions to the isles and choose your  
character assets.

```
SUNDERING
How did the isles earn their name?
```

```
1–33 A great war left horrible scars upon the isles.
A generations-old war is only recently ended, and the reminders of that
fruitless conflict are all around us. Islands wracked by destruction, seas
tainted, people displaced. The cost is immeasurable, but some still squabble
over what remains.
Quest Starter: A people, displaced by war, live on a remote island. A
recent illness left many sick or dead. Supplies are urgently needed. Why
do you swear to give them aid? Who stands against you, and why?
34–67 Eons ago, a vast cataclysm shattered continents.
Lands broke apart in an apocalyptic disaster. Powerful cities fell. Fire, lava,
and ash scoured what remained. The isles, scattered like broken shards, are
the vestiges of these once-great lands, the gravestones of a fallen dominion.
Life eventually returned to this realm, but the wounds do not fully heal.
Quest Starter: You are haunted by dreams of this ancient cataclysm.
In those dreams, you see a grand library of unfathomable scope, the
collected knowledge of lost people and fallen dominions. What do you
seek within this repository?
68–100 Strange technologies unleashed a reality-fracturing wave of cursed
energy, forever reshaping the isles.
An ambitious few dabbled in ancient secrets, and in doing so, broke the
bonds of reality. Strange energies flowed into our world, allowing uncanny
phenomena to take hold. Science and magic took new forms. People and
creatures of other realms were cast into our own like jetsam in a turbulent
tide. The isles are forever altered by the curse of these chaotic realities.
Quest Starter: An explorer brings news. They’ve located what they say is
a nexus of chaotic energy. If it could be deactivated, the isles might find
some measure of peace. Which power or foe seeks to harness this power
to their own ends?
```

9 If you are all that remains of a pre-Sundering people, culture, or tradition, you might  
be a VESTIGE. If the echoes of the cataclysm have left you with unnatural powers,  
you might be a SORCERER. If you embody the legacy of a deep-dwelling people, you  
might be WATERBORN.

8 A seafaring tribe seeks to locate and unite scattered people displaced during the  
Sundering. An order of sorcerers exploits the chaotic forces that caused the cataclysm.

```
RELICS
What remains of lost or fallen people?
```

```
1–33 The long history of the isles is marked by disaster, war, and exodus.
Abandoned and ruined sites are grim monuments to these events.
Former communities—even entire islands—are sometimes forsaken by
their people. Others are lost and forgotten through the ravages of time.
These places echo with the memories of lost lives, but also remind us of the
perseverance of those who survived to carry on their traditions elsewhere.
Quest Starter: An uninhabited island is marked by the ruins of a once-
great city. Someone important to you led an expedition to that island
months ago, but has not returned. What were they in search of?
34–67 Two centuries ago, a powerful empire dared to claim these isles as their
own. Ruined places are all that remain to mark their hubris.
The tattered banners of the fallen empire lie amid ravaged fortresses,
wrecked ships, and abandoned cities. In some places, nature reclaimed
these sites. In others, people return to build anew upon the graves of these
former invaders. Meanwhile, scavengers—like gulls picking at the bones of
dead fish—scour the remnants in search of plunder.
Quest Starter: The emperor wore a crown adorned with two gems of
unsurpassed size and quality: a blue diamond to honor Wraith, and a
fiery ruby to represent Cinder. The resting place of the emperor and this
crown are a mystery—one you are determined to solve.
68–100 An ancient civilization of unfathomable power left its mark upon the isles.
These people unlocked secrets beyond our understanding. The ruins
marking their legacy are places of unnatural construction, confounding
mechanisms, and cryptic relics. Some islanders revere the ancients. Others
seek to understand them. A few have more selfish motives—pillaging the
sites for treasure and artifacts. But some secrets are best left buried. Many
ruins are cursed, corrupted by time, and haunted by malignant evil.
Quest Starter: Dozens of ancient towers have flared to life, sending
up beacons of light visible from leagues away. These lodestars form a
marked path that stretches well beyond the far horizon. Why do you set
out to see where this path leads?

9 If you are dedicated to searching out mysteries or preserving the legacy of lost

be a SCAVENGER.  
8 A society of researchers and archaeologists works to understand lost people and

robbers. An underground ring of fortune seekers supplies a black market trade of

MODERN ERA
What is the state of technology?
```

```
1–33 It is an age of sail.
Sailing ships navigate the farthest reaches and weather the fiercest storms.
Their cannons unleash devastating barrages against rivals or raiders, and their
crews wield muskets and blades to defend their decks. Some commanders
plot a course through hazardous waters with chart and sextant, while others
rely on a deeper understanding of sea and sky. But above all else, we trust in
the loyalty of our shipmates and the strength of our vows.
Quest Starter: A famed shipwright, nearing the end of their life, seeks
to build their magnum opus—a ship of uncompromising beauty and
strength. What rare material do they require, and where is it found?
34–67 It is an age of industry.
The winds of change are upon us. Some of these innovations inspire awe—
flying machines that sail among the clouds, metal diving bells that plumb the
greatest depths, and mechanical limbs of intricate design to replace what
was lost. But industry is also an insatiable fire. Mines, smelters, and factories
reshape our lands to feed those flames. Titanic ships seek dominance of the
isles. Is it only a matter of time before our steadfast wooden ships and the
simple ways of our communities are relics of a bygone age?
Quest Starter: An iron submersible stalks seagoing passages. Why do
you seek vengeance against this vessel’s commander?
68–100 It is an age of wonders.
Some have wielded ancient secrets and extraordinary science to power
vessels, weapons, and other machines. Their ships are fitted with energized
sails that augment the powers of wind and storm. Their cannons unleash
volleys of infernal energies. A few commanders even count iron automatons,
given life by improbable technologies, among their crew. Resisting these
wonders is like casting a stone against a thunderstorm, and many see this
new age as a portent of our doom.
Quest Starter: An enemy faction is building a colossal machine of
fantastic destructive potential. What is the nature of this machine, and
why are you sworn to see it destroyed?
```

9 If you hew to the traditions of shipbuilding and repair, you might be a SHIPWRIGHT.  
If you understand the intricacies of machines, you might be a GEARHEAD. If you are

industrialized trade company is ever-hungrier for raw materials. An order of artificers  
crafts extraordinary machines. A fellowship of outcast automatons must find their

IRON VOWS
What is the significance of iron and sworn vows?
```

```
1–33 Some see iron vows as a vestige of a more superstitious age, but the
tradition persists.
Our forebears bound their promises to the strength and permanence of iron.
Today, self-avowed Ironsworn respect this tradition by affirming their resolve
with a time-honored phrase: “By iron, I vow.” Even those who forgo an iron
totem say the words to lend solemnity to a promise, setting themselves on
an honorbound course—wherever it may lead.
Quest Starter: The Iron Tide, a force of warships whose commanders
and crews have taken up the vow of their fallen leader, is bound for
local waters. What do they seek, and why do you swear your own vow
to prevent it?
34–67 The Ironsworn bind their honor to iron blades.
Even in this age of cannon and rifle, a finely-wrought blade—whether sword
or dagger, dirk or bayonet—remains a mark of skill and resolve. When the
Ironsworn swear a vow upon a blade, we bind our commitment to the metal.
If we forsake a vow, that iron must be abandoned. To be Ironsworn without
a blade is to be disgraced.
Quest Starter: You carry a broken sword. How was it broken, and what
must you do to be worthy of a reforged blade?
68–100 Since the distant time when iron was first hammered into form, seafaring
folk of this world carried iron bondstones as sacred keepsakes.
Each bondstone is unique—a relic of kin and culture—passed from one
generation to the next. They are said to connect the soul of its keeper to
their homeland or loved ones as if by an invisible thread. Thus, if lost at sea,
our spirit may return home rather than remain entombed in the remorseless
depths. We swear our vows upon bondstones as promises that follow us to
our death—and beyond. But bondstones can also embody the curses of lost
lives and forsaken vows, and bearing that weight can make them feel as
heavy as a ship’s anchor.
Quest Starter: A merciless and powerful raider wears the bondstones of
their victims as trophies. One of those totems is rightfully yours. To whom
did it previously belong?
```

9 If you are sworn to a cause, you might be BANNERSWORN. If you carry an  
honorbound blade, you might be a BLADEMASTER. If you fight for personal honor,  
you might be a DUELIST. If your vows are shared with those in your charge, you might  
be a CREW COMMANDER.

8 An order of Ironsworn wardens is dedicated to protecting the people of the isles.  
A band of iron privateers sells their vows—and their loyalty—to the highest bidder.

NAVIGATION
How are people and places connected?
```

```
1–33 We are scattered to the winds, but our connections persist.
The people of the isles are often isolated. Trade and communication must
overcome distance and the fickle nature of the surrounding waterways.
Known passages are undone by tumultuous weather, capricious seas, or
unforeseen conflicts. In spite of those challenges, skilled voyagers and their
indomitable vessels are a tether that binds the people and places of remote
seas into a greater community.
Quest Starter: The port city of Stormrest is a perennial center of
community and trade within the isles. But this city is now cut-off by an
invading or occupying force. Who threatens this longstanding refuge?
34–67 We rely on the ancient traditions and knowledge of the Starmarked to
navigate these perilous seas.
The Starmarked have an uncanny sense of wind and tide, and bear the history
of their travels as beautiful and intricate tattoos—etched in phosphorescent
ink. Some of the places and passages pioneered by the Starmarked are
now common knowledge, inscribed in charts and traveled widely. Others
are coveted secrets, or lost to time and strife. The skills of the Starmarked
make them highly valued as ship navigators, and some seek to exploit them
to their own ends.
Quest Starter: In recent years, many Starmarked have not returned
from expeditions into a remote area of the isles. Is there someone—or
something—that does not want to be found?
68–100 Bleakmists are a curse upon the isles, confounding navigation and
severing connections between communities.
Bleakmists are a damnable, seabound fog. Mariners tell of inexplicable
sensations within the cursed waters of the mists—whispered voices, the
ghostly clanging of ship bells, half-seen phantom shapes. Some bleakmists
never dissipate, forming an enduring barrier that only the most foolhardy
attempt to navigate. In other places, mists gather with little warning. Once
you enter a bleakmist, it’s hard to predict where—or if—you’ll emerge.
Quest Starter: Someone will pay well for passage through an everlasting
bleakmist. What do they seek on the other side?
```

9 If you are skilled at finding your way among the isles, you might be a NAVIGATOR. If  
you trailblaze inland paths, you might be an OVERLANDER. If you carry precious items  
on your expeditions, you might be a COURIER. If you wield mystical powers over the  
wind to see a ship safely on its way, you might be a **WINDBINDER**.

EMPIRES
How great is the threat of colonization and conquest?
```

```
1–33 The Sundered Isles are free from imperial control—for now.
The empires have only a minor presence; their outposts are isolated and
pose little threat. But there are resources and riches to be exploited, and
freedom is a fragile thing. Even now, imperial agents are said to be among
us, working in the shadows, planting the seeds of conquest.
Quest Starter: A conflict between two nations is raging. Some suggest
the war was sparked by imperial agents, working behind the scenes to
destabilize the region and open a path for colonization. Can you convince
the leaders of these powers to abandon their fighting and focus on the
true threat?
34–67 Imperial forces vie for dominion over the Sundered Isles.
Imperial colonization and exploitation is a creeping tide that threatens to
engulf the isles. Colonial governors oversee ever-expanding settlements,
while powerful trade companies control key trade routes and resources.
Imperial agents conduct missions of subterfuge and assassination. Treaties
between the empires are forged and broken on a whim, and mariners can
never be certain of what flag will fly over a port from one day to the next.
Quest Starter: Envoys and aristocrats gather for a gala at a governor’s
manor house, where a priceless object will be on display as a
demonstration of the governor’s power and wealth. If a clever thief were
to abscond with that item, it would undermine the governor and foment
suspicion among the attendees. What is this object?
68–100 In the wake of a tumultuous war, a powerful empire prevailed. This
supreme power holds the fate of the Sundered Isles in an iron grasp.
A time before the empire is a fading memory. Today, their armies and fleets
control large swaths of territory in the isles, and their expeditionary forces
use coercion and warfare to expand their dominion ever further. Other
nations are little more than vassals, their puppet governments loyal to the
empire. But there are whispers that the empire has grown complacent. Is this
the day the once-freeborn people of the isles relight the fires of revolution
and reclaim their legacy?
Quest Starter: A valuable prisoner is held in an imperial fortress. Who is
this person, and why are they the best hope for rebellion?
```

9 If you resolve disputes and secure anti-imperial alliances, you might be a DIPLOMAT.  
If you battle empires with blades and daring, you might be a SWASHBUCKLER. If you  
work in the shadows, you might be a SPY. If you navigate court intrigues, you might  
be a SOCIALITE. If you are on the run from imperial forces, you might be a FUGITIVE.

PIRACY
What influence do pirates wield?
```

```
1–33 Pirates are merciless raiders.
Pirates give no quarter to seagoing targets and raze settlements on a whim.
Their loyalty is only to crew and captain, but even that bond is fragile.
Ritualized duels to decide the captaincy or settle disputes are common, and
a long-lived marauder is a rare thing. If you come upon a gray-haired pirate,
be wary; they have outwitted sailors better than you a thousand times over.
Quest Starter: You possess one-third of a coded map said to lead to a
fabled pirate treasure. What infamous pirates hold the other pieces?
Will you form an uneasy alliance to collect and divide the treasure, or
take the other pieces of the map by force?
34–67 Pirates are fiercely independent, but bound by a shared code.
A pirate crew is a power unto itself, a diverse band of fugitives, outcasts, and
rebels who serve under a ship’s charter and have a say in the operation of
the vessel. Pirates do not attack indiscriminately, and give quarter to those
who ask for it. They are nevertheless vilified as barbarous murderers by trade
guilds, imperial governors, and other powers in the isles. In some ways, this
reputation serves them; fear is more powerful than the mightiest cannons or
the sharpest swords.
Quest Starter: A former pirate, given a pardon and a letter of marque,
has sent countless pirates to their doom. Who is this turncoat, and why
do you plot to see their reign of the seas ended?
68–100 A burgeoning pirate nation wields great influence.
The marauder clans sail under the command of the Dread Court, a conclave
of eight veteran pirates whose shrewd tactics positioned this nation of
cutthroats as a rising power. Once each year, the pirate fleets gather at a
port called Flotsam—an artificial island built from the husks of captured and
ruined ships—to pay homage to the Court and make plans.
Quest Starter: There are schisms within the Dread Court. An assassination
has tipped the latest gathering into chaos and threatens the future of
this burgeoning power. Will you work to restore the alliance, or use the
mayhem to your own advantage?
```

9 If you hunt marauding pirates, you might be a BOUNTY HUNTER. If you serve  
among a band of pirates, you might be a CUTTHROAT. If you are a young greenhorn  
or stowaway among a pirate crew, you might be an URCHIN. If you stand in command  
of a pirate ship, you might be a PIRATE CAPTAIN.  
8 An alliance of pirates unites against a common enemy. A guild of pirate hunters

RELIGION
What is the role of faith?
```

```
1–33 Our faith is as diverse as the people.
Many have no religion, or offer an occasional prayer out of habit. Others pay
homage to the gods of our ancestors as a way of connecting to their roots.
Some idolize the natural order of the world, and see the divine in the ebb
and flow of the tides or the whirling dance of the stars. Then there are those
who see this diversity as imperfection, who seek only to bend the world to
their righteous will.
Quest Starter: A pilgrim seeks passage to remote and dangerous
waters. What holy place do they seek?
34–67 The gods enact their will through manifestations and miracles.
We chronicle the visitations of the gods in our histories, and decipher their
enigmatic purpose through sacred rites. In times of crisis, their earthly
avatars have guided us through the upheaval. For many, faith in these
gods offers meaning and fulfillment. For others, belief is a cudgel used by
tyrannical leaders to divide or control us. For this reason, some people and
cultures disavow the gods to follow a different path.
Quest Starter: You bear the mark of a god. The priests declare this as
a sign you are chosen to fulfill a destiny. Do you accept this fate, and
swear to see it through, or are you determined to see it undone? What
force opposes you?
68–100 The gods are dead.
In a time before memory, the gods of the isles warred with each other. These
seas were their battleground, and they ushered in an age of destruction that
plunged all the lands into fire and darkness. In their death throes, they left
behind areas of tainted seas and forsaken landscapes—a cursed corruption
that lingers even today. The hubris of these fallen gods is a reminder of the
empty promise of faith.
Quest Starter: A cult seeks to take control of a site reputed to hold an
artifact of the fallen gods. What holy object do they seek? Why are you
sworn to stop them?
```

9 If you are an ardent follower of a religion or creed, you might be a DEVOTANT. If  
you follow a prophesied path, you might be FATED. If you are cursed by the gods with

8 A tribe of nature-worshipers is sworn to protect the Isles against despoilers. An

MAGIC
What is the impact of supernatural forces?
```

```
1–33 Magic does not exist.
Some find comfort in the old ways. Mariners heed a thousand superstitions
to help ensure a safe voyage. A few perform elaborate rituals to gain the
favor of the wind or cast runes to divine one's future. But true magic—if it
ever existed—is lost to us now.
Quest Starter: Someone close to you is accused of casting a curse upon
a settlement. Will you defend this person and uncover the true cause of
the settlement’s troubles?
34–67 Magic is rare and mysterious.
The isles lie at the nexus of the new and the old, science and superstition,
the known and the inexplicable. This collision of realities is a powerful but
chaotic force, and rare folk can manipulate these unstable realities to cast
spells and perform rites. In some cultures, mystics are respected; in others,
they are feared or even outcast.
Quest Starter: A powerful but outcast sorcerer lives alone on a faraway
island. Why do you have urgent need of their abilities? What enemy or
rival is on the hunt for this person?
68–100 Magic is an ever-present, elemental force.
Magic is as constant as the winds and tides. Talented mystics exploit these
energies to shape natural forces, divine the past and the future, and cast
boons and curses. A few can even breathe unnatural life into the dead.
Many mystics join guilds or serve under mentors to hone their craft, while
others make do with raw, untrained talent. In spite of their uncanny nature,
mystics are often hired as aides for powerful leaders, or to help guide
ships on perilous voyages. But as the winds and tides are fickle, so is
magic, and some fall prey to the dark curse of these forces.
Quest Starter: Someone you love is corrupted by cursed powers, and is
set on a destructive course of vengeance. What caused their fall? Do you
seek to save them or defeat them?
```

9 If you posses supernatural powers, you might be an EMPATH, KINETIC,  
NECROMANCER, SEER, SHADE, SORCERER, or WINDBINDER. If your unnatural  
abilities have made you a pariah, you might be an OUTCAST.

BEASTS
What is the nature of extraordinary creatures?

```
1–33 Beasts are lost to myth, but the tales persist.
For most, monstrous beasts are the stuff of fables. But a few who journey
across trackless isles and unknown seas claim otherwise. Some even bear
the scars of those alleged encounters.
Quest Starter: In the highland jungles of a remote island, a settlement is
plagued by attacks from an unknown creature. Five dead in these last
few months, and fear and suspicion is rampant. What is your connection
to this place?
34–67 Beasts lurk in watery depths and within the reaches of remote islands.
All manner of creatures dwell among the isles—including rare and incredible
beasts of legend. Among them are colossal great whales and elder rays,
larger than our greatest ship, and blade-winged sea dragons. Some foolish
souls hunt these creatures for riches or sport. Others revere and protect
them. A few are beast-bonded, forming an enduring friendship with their
beast-kin.
Quest Starter: The captain of a powerful ship lost something dear to them
when battling a beast, and has sworn vengeance against the creature.
What is the nature of this beast? Do you aid the captain in their ill-fated
quest, or stand against them to protect the creature?
68–100 Here, there be monsters.
We are trespassers in a cursed realm of beasts. Monstrous lizards stalk the
inland wilds. Flying reptiles with wings the size of topsails dwell in cliffside
nests. Giant sharks and serpents cruise the coastal waters in search of
prey. The much-feared Kraken, larger than the greatest warship, lurks in
fathomless depths. And some ancient beasts are too monstrous, too
horrible, for even our worst imaginings.
Quest Starter: Tales tell of the means of forming a bond with the mightiest
of the world’s beasts, the Kraken. Many have undertaken this quest, but
none have succeeded. What must you accomplish to gain an accord with
the Kraken, and why would you face this trial?
```

9 If you are skilled at battling beasts, you might be a SLAYER or HARPOONER. If you  
are bound to a beast, you might ride a DRAGON or summon THE KRAKEN. If you

HORRORS
What dreadful forces haunt the Sundered Isles?
```

```
1–33 Put enough grog in a sailor, and they’ll tell you stories of doomed ships
and ghostly visitations. It’s nonsense.
There’s enough to fear amid the isles without worrying about fanciful tales
of ghosts and ghouls. Nonetheless, sailors are a superstitious folk. On dark
nights, when a dead calm falls over the sea, they keep a wary eye for ships
that sail heedless of the wind.
Quest Starter: Years ago, a ship bearing a stolen treasure was sunk in
a fierce storm. But mariners report seeing this vessel sailing under the
light of the Wraith moon, its sails tattered, its weather decks empty. It
is a cursed ship, folks say, doomed to carry its ill-gotten treasure for all
eternity. Why do you intend to prove or disprove this tale?
34–67 The veil between life and death is as fragile as gossamer.
In the darkest reaches of the isles, ghost ships stalk the seas, undead
guardians protect ancient tombs, and drowned sailors emerge from the
depths in search of absolution or vengeance. Others may scoff at these
tales, but we know the truth—death waits for us all, but is not always an end.
Quest Starter: Your ship is haunted by its former captain. At night, they
are sometimes seen on the quarterdeck, staring grimly at the distant
horizon. What unfulfilled vow torments this restless spirit? Why do you
swear to see it done?
68–100 The damned and the dead are a plague upon the isles.
We live in accursed times. The drowned and the buried do not rest. Tortured
spirits hunt for retribution. Uncounted islands are blighted by dark forces.
Cities and villages lie abandoned and forsaken, lost to a malevolent tide. We
keep watch, craft wards, and offer prayers to keep the horrors at bay, but it
is no use. They are coming.
Quest Starter: For generations, an infamous ghost fleet has haunted
these seas, sending countless mariners to their doom. Why do you now
seek to form an alliance with the cursed commander of this fleet?
```

9 If you are plagued by a ghost, you might be HAUNTED. If you dedicate yourself to  
battling undead or monstrous forces, you might be a SLAYER. If you have unnatural

## SET YOUR FACTIONS

What people and powers inhabit your version of the isles? In this exercise, taking  
inspiration from your truths, you choose or envision a handful of influential factions.  
These choices help set in motion the conflicts and interconnections of your setting,  
and provide inspiration for encounters at sea and ashore.  
As part of this exercise, you’ll want to record some notes. Grab some index cards or  
notepaper, or open up a new page in your digital journal.  
Allow about 10–20 minutes for this exercise.

INTRODUCE YOUR FACTIONS  
Consider the outcome of the truths exercise. What important or interesting powers  
come to mind? Is there a single, oppressive empire? Multiple empires? What people  
and organizations inhabit the isles? Do supernatural forces wield power or authority  
in your world? For the purposes of this exercise, make note of three or four factions.  
You’ll encounter other people and powers through the course of your story, but this is  
enough to get things rolling.

If you are playing with others, take turns suggesting a faction. Use this as an  
opportunity to discuss character concepts, what brought you together as allies, and  
how a suggested faction can tie into your character’s background or motivations.

RECORDING FACTION  
DETAILS  
Give each faction a name and a  
short summary with a few commonly  
understood details. Two to four  
bullet points are about right.

If you’d prefer to keep it simple, start  
with a placeholder description—for  
example, “Tyrannical Empire” or  
“Undead Pirates.”

WANT INSPIRATION?  
If you’d like suggestions for factions, turn to pages 52 – 55. You’ll find brief  
summaries for factions across four categories: societies, organizations, empires,  
and the cursed. You can roll for a random faction, pick from any list, or customize and  
combine options. Elaborate on your choices as you like, and consider any unanswered  
questions implied by the descriptions.  
Let your selections—even random ones—support your truths in the previous exercise  
and your preferences for the campaign. If colonial empires are not present in your  
version of the isles or hold no influence, ignore them. If supernatural forces do not  
exist, you can treat cursed factions as myths or rumors.  
You can also generate details using the Faction Oracles (page 176). Or look to real-  
world history, other games, or media for inspiration—adjust and reimagine as needed.

**Forsaken Fleet ORGANIZATION**

**-** Infamous clan of pirates  
**-** Led by a marauder known as the

**-** Sacked a major port town, and made

**-** Ships have black sails

THE RELEVANCE TEST  
For each faction you introduce, answer three questions.

1. Does this faction fit the world I am creating?
2. Can this faction motivate quests, connections, or threats for my character?
3. Can this faction interact with at least one other faction to create conflict or intrigue?

If the answer to any of those questions is “no,” rethink the faction or choose another. If  
the answers are only a tentative or qualified “yes,” that’s good enough. Let it simmer.  
You’ll have time to adjust, even once your story is underway.

DEFINE FACTION RELATIONSHIPS  
Now that you have a handful of factions to set loose in your world, you can brainstorm  
their relationships to help envision opportunities for conflict and drama in your story.

CONNECT THE DOTS  
Take a moment to consider how the factions relate to each other. Are they at war?  
Allied against a mutual foe? Is one supporting the other—perhaps in secret? For some  
factions, this might be obvious. An empire is likely in conflict with factions that stand  
against them. Pirate clans undertake piracy, although they may use discretion when  
choosing targets. Other relationships might be more nuanced.  
Give each faction a relationship with at least one other faction. If you’re unsure, choose  
two factions, and use the table below to help frame the relationship of one to another.  
Reroll or adjust any result that doesn’t fit, or consider how that result might signal an  
unexpected relationship. If you’d like more options, you can also use the expanded  
version of this table on page 177.

```

31–40 Indebted to 81–90 Splintered from
41–50 Maneuvering against 91–100 Trades resources or favors with
```

LINKING FACTIONS TO YOUR CHARACTER  
If any of the factions offer a potential backstory, origin, or opposition for your character,  
make note of it. Factions can help ground your character’s place in the world and  
motivate them into action.

MARK IT DOWN  
Add important relationship details to your summary card. Keep in mind that you are  
only deciding the commonly understood connection between those factions, and that  
further investigation or events may reveal a deeper or alternate truth.

If helpful, you can create a relationship map for factions as described on page 51.  
But it might be best to save that for later. Let the factions and their relationships deepen  
through a session or two, and take what you’ve learned to craft a relationship map.

Use them to help envision your character. Make note of any
interesting ideas or questions these tools evoke.
```

### STEP 3:

### CHOOSE

### TWO PATHS

```
Select two path assets from your Sundered Isles deck (pages
14 – 15 ). Choose assets that support an interesting
character concept, reflect the nature of your world, and foster
the stories that you and other players want to explore.
For guidance or inspiration, check the Persona tables on
pages 94– 95.
```

90 GETTING UNDERWAY

### STEP 6:

### SET YOUR

### STATS AND

### METERS

```
Set your stats by arranging these values across edge, heart,
iron, shadow, and wits in any order: 3, 2, 2, 1, 1. To learn more
about your stats, see the Starforged rulebook (page 110).
Next, set your condition meters and momentum to their
starting values. Set your health, spirit, and supply to 5. Set
your momentum to +2, your max momentum to +10, and your
momentum reset to +2.
```

### STEP 5:

### WRITE YOUR

### BACKGROUND

### VOW

```
What ambition, need, or commitment drives you? This is your
background vow. Mark the vow and give it an epic rank. If
you’re not sure, save it for later—or look for inspiration on an
oracle table such as Character Goals (page 193).
To learn more about your background vow, see page 107 of
the Starforged rulebook.
```

### STEP 4:

### NAME YOUR

### CHARACTER

```
Give your character a name. For inspiration, check the Names
table on page 194. If you are known by a moniker or title,
note that as well. Then, mark down your character’s pronouns.
```

### STEP 7:

### PREPARE

### TO TAKE

### COMMAND

```
In the next exercise, you decide if you begin your adventures
with a ship of your own to command, as well as the nature of
your ship and crew. You also choose a final asset to complete
your character. Go to page 96 to take command.
```

### YOUR SUNDERED ISLES ASSETS

As you begin this exercise, ready your deck using the outline and suggestions on  
pages 14– 15.

During the exercise, you select two paths from that deck to form a basic character  
concept. For example, you might be a SCOUNDREL and SOCIALITE or a  
SWASHBUCKLER and PIRATE CAPTAIN. Then, in the next exercise, you choose one  
additional asset. Plus, if you begin your adventures in command of a seagoing vessel,  
you start with an undistinguished SAILING SHIP or your FLAGSHIP command vehicle.

BUILDING A TEAM WITH ALLIES  
If you are working through this exercise with other players, take turns completing steps.  
Talk it through to create an interesting group with a reason to adventure together, but  
don’t get hung up on unnecessary details. Leave unanswered questions to figure out  
through the course of your story.

CREATE YOUR CHARACTER 91

What is your backstory? What events or compelling need put you on a path of  
adventure? If you’re not sure, roll or choose on this table for inspiration.

This table uses an optional cursed die, as indicated by the skull icon: 6. This is an  
extra ten-sided die added to an oracle roll—one distinct from your oracle dice. If the  
cursed die rolls a 10, your answer is cursed—take the value of your oracle dice and  
check the cursed version of the table for your answer. The notation beside the cursed  
icon guides you to the location of that table. In this case, it’s on the next page. For  
details on the cursed die, see page 114.

Note: The @ **1–2** symbol means you should roll or choose once or twice, as you like.

YOUR CHARACTERISTICS  
Use any of the prompts below that are helpful. Answer the question yourself or check  
the indicated table for an answer. If a response is uninteresting or a poor fit, ignore it.  
In fact, rejecting what doesn’t work is part of sharpening the focus.

Keep in mind that you can start with the sketchiest idea for your character and flesh  
them out through play. These prompts are optional.  
✴ What aspects of your look or personality are obvious at first glance? Roll or  
choose once or twice on the Character First Look table (page 186).  
✴ What is your former or current profession? Roll or choose once on the Character  
Roles table (page 187), then roll or choose on the related subtable ( 188 – 189 ).  
✴ What accessory or piece of gear helps define your look? Roll or choose once or  
twice on the Trademark Accessories table (page 190).  
✴ If you are armed, what is your favored weapon? Roll or choose once on the  
Trademark Weapons table (page 191).  
✴ What are less-obvious or hidden aspects of your nature? Roll or choose once or  
twice on the Character Details table (page 192).  
✴ What drives you? Roll or choose once on the Character Goals table (page 193).  
✴ You possess an object of personal significance. What is it? Roll or choose once  
on the Tokens table (page 223).

CREATE YOUR CHARACTER 95

## TAKE COMMAND

In this exercise, you decide whether to explore your character’s progression as a  
seafarer through the course of your story, or begin in command of an able ship and  
crew. We’ll also wrap up your character by picking a final asset.

```
Allow about 10–20 minutes for this exercise.
```

CHOOSE YOUR COMMAND  
Select from these three options. If you are playing with allies, pick a command  
together—irrespective of your individual roles. One of you might take on the position  
of captain, but everyone helps guide the ship and crew on their way.

### OPTION 1:

### NOVICE

### COMMAND

```
You are in command of a ship, but it is a minor vessel of little
repute. This is the default campaign start.
You are a greenhorn captain or fallen on bad times. Your crew is much
like the ship—unremarkable. Some are inexperienced. Some are
indifferent. But with time, you may grow to rely on one another. Your
ship will come into its own, or you will claim another. Can you forge a
worthy legacy among the isles?
Take the asset card for the incidental SAILING SHIP. Decide if it is
light, medium, or heavy. If in doubt, make it light and envision it as
a small sloop, ketch, or cutter—a nimble but fragile vessel. To learn
more about this starting ship, see page 17.
```

### OPTION 2:

### WORTHY

### COMMAND

```
You are in command of an admirable vessel and able crew.
You begin your story with the wind in your sails. Will you hold this ship
and crew together amid the perils of the isles?
Take the FLAGSHIP command vehicle asset. This asset is normally
gained when you Advance and spend experience. But as a seasoned
commander, you skip the queue and claim this prize at the start of
your story. Learn more about the FLAGSHIP asset on page 18.
```

### OPTION 3:

### NO

### COMMAND

```
You do not have a ship or command of your own—yet.
If you are a mariner, you serve under the command of a non-player
character on their ship, or are stranded or marooned without a ship.
Or perhaps the sea has yet to sing its siren song, and your adventures
are found ashore. You might traverse rugged island landscapes as a
guide, skulk among the back alleys of a city-state as a street urchin, or
navigate the intrigues of imperial politics as a secret insurgent.
Either way, your destiny lies on a seabound course. Will you someday
stand at the helm of your own mighty ship?
```

SHIP HISTORY  
If you have a command, envision how you claimed or earned the vessel. For inspiration,  
use the table below. If you sail under the command of a non-player character, you can  
use this table to give their ship a backstory.

```
1–5 Acquired in a duel of honor
6–10 Awarded by a vote of the crew, after the former captain died an untimely death
11–15 Bestowed by an eccentric shipwright
16–20 Built or refitted by a community, and granted to its captain as their emissary
21–25 Captured in battle, and awarded by the former captain
26–30 Earned in exchange for a perilous undertaking or heroic deed
31–35 Entrusted by a faction, and commanded in their service
36–40 Found as a wreck, and refitted to make it seaworthy
41–45 Gifted by an anonymous benefactor
46–50 Inherited from a dead or missing relative or mentor
51–55 Leased under exorbitant terms
56–60 Obtained in trade for a precious object
61–65 Obtained through a false identity or counterfeit documents
66–70 On grant from an underworld figure in exchange for completing unscrupulous missions
71–75 Once a timeworn, unwanted ship, painstakingly refitted to its new role
76–80 Purchased at a suspiciously cheap price
81–85 Seized in a mutiny against its former captain
86–90 Stolen from under the nose of a powerful faction
91–95 Taken while fleeing an attack or disaster
96–100 Won in a high-stakes bet
```

```
1–10 Awarded by its former—and now dead—captain, who still haunts its decks
11–20 Bound to a role as its new commander by a beguiling curse
21–30 Cobbled together from salvage found within a graveyard of forsaken ships
31–40 Discovered within a hidden sea cave after calling to you in a dream
41–50 Found adrift in perfect condition, with no sign of the crew
51–60 Gifted by a dreadful entity in exchange for a dark favor
61–70 Granted in an accursed agreement, sealed in blood
71–80 Improbably found as a derelict well inland; moved and refloated with much effort
81–90 Raised from the sunken depths as a boon from the sea itself
91–100 Taken in spite of its cursed reputation, when no one else would sail it

SHIP CHARACTERISTICS  
Envision the ship’s look and nature. For inspiration, use any of the prompts below. If  
a rolled response on a table doesn’t fit, reimagine it, reroll, or ignore it and move on.  
✴ What size is the ship? Roll or choose once on the Ship Size table (page 132).  
Ignore or reroll the “Force” results.  
✴ What aspects of the ship’s look or nature are obvious when first sighted? Roll  
or choose once or twice on the Ship First Look table (page 134).  
✴ What symbol does it bear on its flag or as a design motif? Roll or choose once  
on the Ship Symbol table (page 136).

**If you roll a curse for Crew Characteristics, take your result on that table and give  
them an eerie, supernatural, or dreadful aspect. Use the table below for inspiration.**

READY TO CLAIM YOUR FINAL ASSET?  
Choose a final asset from these categories: Support Vehicle, Module (only if you  
command a FLAGSHIP), Path, or Companion. For the full list of recommended  
Sundered Isles assets, see pages 14 – 15.

Do not choose a Deed asset for your starting character. Those represent notable  
achievements and situations in your story, and are taken when you Advance.

If you want to start simple, or you’d like to get a better sense of your character and  
their challenges before making a choice, feel free to bank this asset for later. Once  
your campaign is underway, you may claim the banked asset—choosing from the  
categories listed above—without paying an experience cost.

CHOOSING CREW-RELATED ASSETS  
If you command a crew and want to spotlight your role as their leader, take CREW  
COMMANDER as your final asset. If you command a pirate ship, the PIRATE CAPTAIN  
asset gives focus to the ebb and flow of your fortunes as buccaneers. If you’d rather  
explore the evolution of your command through the course of your story, save them  
for when you Advance. To learn more about these command assets, see page 23.

SET YOUR REMAINING CONDITION METERS  
Set the integrity of your SAILING SHIP, FLAGSHIP, or support vehicles to their  
max value. Also, set your ship’s hold supply to its max value. Finally, if you have a  
companion, set its health to its max value.

TAKE COMMAND 99

## CHART YOUR COURSE

In this exercise, you’ll chart key locations in a local area, including a few islands and a  
seaside settlement. This is where your adventures begin.  
Allow about 30–45 minutes for this exercise.

Have ready the navigation chart worksheet and connections worksheet from the  
Sundered Isles Playkit. You’ll also want something to record notes for the locations,  
such as your journal or a stack of notecards. If you are playing using a digital tool or  
prefer another template, you need space for notes and a simple map.

If playing with others, one of you can read or summarize each step of this exercise.  
Everyone can participate in making decisions, rolling on oracle tables, and embellishing  
narrative hooks. Keep things moving, and don’t get hung up on details. You’ll discover  
more about these locations and the people who live there through play.

WHAT IS A NAVIGATION CHART?  
A navigation chart is a local map of islands and surrounding features. Your charts  
help track the progress of your journeys and discoveries within a manageable scope.  
Over time, you may create several charts as you move beyond the bounds of your  
starting area.  
Learn more about navigation charts on page 34.

NAVIGATING THE ORACLES  
During this exercise, you generate details for your starting location using several  
oracles. It might be helpful to bookmark those sections now to make it easier to  
move back and forth.  
✴ Island Oracles (page 142)  
✴ Settlement Oracles (page 164)  
✴ Character Oracles (page 186).

As you work through this exercise, roll or choose on the oracle tables as you like.  
Ignore or revise any details that don’t fit the established facts of your setting.

BUILDING OTHER REALMS  
If you are sailing the skyfaring realm, this exercise helps generate a starting area with  
only minor reimagining. If you plan to adventure in the spacefaring realm, you should  
instead use the Sector Creation Exercise in the Starforged rulebook (page 114) to  
generate local planets and settlements.

### PREFER TO CUT AND RUN?

**If you want a more seat-of-the-pants start for your campaign, or already have an  
idea of a location you want to focus on, feel free to skip this exercise. This leaves the  
details to be discovered in play.**

100 GETTING UNDERWAY

### MYRIADS

These principal isles  
are widely settled. If  
you want to sail busy  
trade routes between  
bustling settlements,  
while keeping a  
weather eye for enemy  
sails, start here.

### MARGINS

```
Greater distances
separate the islands
and settlements
within this region. If
you want to navigate
less-traveled waters
between remote
places, start here.
```

### REACHES

```
Here the islands
and people are
most scattered and
isolated, the seas
most unfamiliar. If
you want to sail on
stranger tides,
start here.
```

STEP 2: SET FACTION INFLUENCE  
The navigation chart worksheet includes a faction influence grid. This tool helps  
manage the presence and dominance of factions in your starting area. Once your  
campaign begins, it can reveal the nature of encounters with ships and settlements.

Check your faction notes from the faction exercise (page 88). Which factions do  
you envision as having a role in this area? Choose a field of the grid for each of them,  
using whichever rank seems most appropriate for that faction’s role in the area and  
your story: dominant, established, subsisting, diminished, or obscure.  
Leave several slots blank. New factions can emerge in the course of your story.

Later in this exercise, you reference this grid to decide which factions have control of a  
key settlement. To learn more about the faction influence grid, see page 50.

STEP 1: CHOOSE YOUR STARTING REGION  
As detailed on page 8, the folk of the isles divide these seas broadly into three  
regions. Choose your starting region and note it on your navigation chart worksheet.

STEP 3: REVEAL ISLANDS  
In this step, you generate the broad characteristics of some  
islands to give your character places to explore when they must  
be away from the sea. These islands might also be home to  
settlements; you generate one of those in the next step.

First, determine the number of islands using the guide  
shown here. This isn’t necessarily the total number of  
islands in this area; it’s just a set of locations to give you a  
footing as your adventures get underway. Then, answer  
the following questions for each of the islands.  
✴ What is the island’s landscape? Roll or choose on the Size, Terrain, and Vitality  
tables (page 142), and take a moment to consider what those results imply about  
the location. Larger islands likely have varying landscapes, but these initial results  
are the dominant characteristics.  
✴ Where is the island located? Pick a spot on your navigation chart and draw a  
rough shape for the island. Give it an island-like outline with squiggly coastlines, or  
just make it a circle or square. But keep it relatively small among the vast seas. You  
want enough room to add the additional known islands in the region and reveal  
new places in the course of your adventures. If it’s a larger island, feel free to put it  
at the edge of the chart and have it extend “out of frame.”  
✴ Are there neighboring islands? Roll or choose on the Nearby Islands table (page  
143 ). If the island is part of a pair or group, add the minor islands to the map near  
the main island. In favorable weather, the members of an island pair or group are  
close enough to be visible from one another, requiring a short sail to travel from  
one to another. Keep it simple; the central island is your focus. You won’t generate  
details for the neighboring isles in this exercise, and they don’t count toward the  
number of islands in the region. They are like moons orbiting a home world.  
✴ What is its name? Roll or choose on the Island Name table (page 147).

Write the island names on your chart, and create a section in your notes for island info.  
Leave space to add more later. When you visit or explore an island, you can generate  
or envision additional details.

STEP 4: BUILD A SEASIDE  
SETTLEMENT  
In this step, you generate a settlement—a populated village,  
town, or city—as a hub for the start of the campaign. Settlements  
are located throughout the Sundered Isles, but tend to be sparser and smaller beyond  
the Myriads. Some settlements are as old as memory, and others are newly founded.

Answer the following questions to introduce the local settlement. This settlement might  
be an important location in the area, your homeport, or simply a potential destination  
as you make your way into these waters.  
✴ Where is the settlement located? Pick an island and mark a location for the  
settlement along the shoreline.  
✴ How populous is the settlement? Roll or choose on the Settlement Size table  
(page 164).  
✴ What are the primary industries or activities? Roll or choose on the Settlement

STEP 6: ADD A LOCAL CONNECTION  
In this step, you add an important character as a connection to  
the local area. This person might be a patron for your character—  
someone of shared purpose who petitions or sponsors your  
initial adventures—or a helpful acquaintance. But keep in mind that connections are  
not shipmates or companions. They are independent characters whose own lives  
occasionally intersect with your own.

Answer these questions to create your local connection. If you are playing with others,  
this is a shared connection.

✴ What is the connection’s role? Decide their duty, expertise, or background. Their  
role offers a bonus when you make a move with their support—it should be general  
enough to be helpful, but specific enough to be flavorful. See page 124 in the  
Starforged rulebook for tips on connection roles.  
✴ What is their rank? The connection’s rank represents the challenge of advancing  
the relationship. The higher the rank, the greater the narrative focus and trouble  
involved to eventually Forge a Bond with them. Choose a rank appropriate to their  
role and the level of involvement you want them to have in your story: troublesome,  
dangerous, formidable, extreme, or epic.  
✴ What goal drives them? Roll or choose on the Character Goals table (page 193).  
✴ What is their name? Roll or choose on the Character Name table (page 194).  
✴ Are they linked to a faction? Referencing your faction influence grid, decide if this  
connection has a relationship with a known faction.  
✴ Where are they found? Choose a settlement or place on the map as the connection’s  
present location. If they are aboard a ship, note where it sails.  
Optionally, you can flesh out a connection with details using the questions below. If  
you’d prefer to keep it simple, wait until you first interact with them to reveal more.  
✴ What are obvious characteristics of the connection? Roll or choose on the  
Character First Look table (page 186).  
✴ What item or gear is this person seldom without? Roll or choose on Trademark  
Accessories (page 190) or Trademark Weapons (page 191).  
✴ What have I learned of this connection over time? Roll or choose on the Character  
Details table (page 192).

Record this person’s name, role, rank, and location on the connections worksheet, and  
add any interesting additional details to your journal or notes.  
A reminder: Introducing this connection at the start of your campaign is essentially a  
“free” strong hit on the Make a Connection move.

### WANT MORE?

**If you envision your character having a more complete understanding of your starting  
area, repeat step 4 (page 103) to add another settlement or two—making them  
seaside or inland as you like. This may give you insight into relations among these  
settlements, but leaves less to uncover in the course of your story.**

STEP 7: NAME THE AREA  
Lastly, give these local seas a name. If you’d like a  
suggestion, roll on the Local Seas table (page 227).

You’re nearly done! In the next exercise, you send  
your character on their perilous course.

CHART YOUR COURSE 107

## SET THE SCENE

In this final exercise, you decide where your story begins and identify a trouble worthy  
of an iron vow. You can make this exercise part of your first proper session of play, or  
use it to lay the keel for future play.

```
Allow about 5–10 minutes for this exercise.
```

THE STATUS QUO  
What is the situation for your character at the start of your campaign? Are you aboard  
a ship? Traveling overland? Arriving at a settlement? Meeting with a local connection?  
Using the map you created in the last exercise, consider where you find yourself or  
where you are bound. If you are playing with others, talk this over as a group.

As described on page 131 of the Starforged rulebook, you can start play with a  
prologue—a bit of character building and downtime before the adventure properly  
begins. Or you can start with a bang in medias res. The simple matter of “Where am  
I, and what am I doing?” can help inform the situations you face in your first session.

THE INCITING INCIDENT  
Near the start of your story, you Swear an Iron Vow to follow a goal, face a problem, or  
undertake a mission. This inciting incident interrupts the status quo and propels you  
into action. Make it a dangerous or troublesome quest.

If you already have a quest in mind to kick-off your story, you’re all set. If not, consider  
the narrative fodder from the previous exercises.

TRUTHS  
✴ Selected truths: Which situations,  
conflicts, or dangers offer an  
opportunities for adventure?  
✴ Quest starters: Are any of the  
adventure seeds worth pursuing?

FACTIONS  
✴ Allied factions: Do you undertake a  
mission for an allied faction?  
✴ Enemy factions: Will you attack or  
undermine an enemy faction?

CHARACTER  
✴ Paths: Do you have any duties, skills,  
or goals that might motivate a quest?  
✴ Backstory: Does your backstory  
imply a danger or goal?  
✴ Team: If playing co-op, do you and  
your allies have a shared goal?

### COMMAND

```
✴ Ship: Is there some aspect of your
ship’s nature or history that must
be dealt with? If you don’t have a
command, do you undertake a quest
to gain a ship of your own?
✴ Crew: Is the ship’s crew facing an
urgent need, hardship, or curse?
LOCAL AREA
✴ Settlement: Are there any settlement
aspects or projects that create an
opportunity for a quest?
✴ Connection: Based on their role or
goal, does your connection need
something from you?
✴ Locations: Is there a location that
requires investigation or some
pressing trouble?
```

108 GETTING UNDERWAY

```
NEED INSPIRATION?
Check page 129 of the Starforged rulebook for details on creating a worthy
inciting incident.
If you’re still unsure how to get things started, roll on a table or two and see
what drives your character at the start of the story. Here’s some suggestions:
✴ A task from a patron or connection: Action + Theme (pages 116– 117 )
✴ An incident at sea: Seafaring Perils (page 128)
✴ A personal mission: Character Goals (page 193)
✴ A mysterious treasure map: Treasure Location (page 220)
If all else fails, make something happen! Marauders attack. The sails
of a tempting prize appear on the horizon. A dying mariner hands you a
bloodstained map. Imperial soldiers arrive in force. A fancy gala is interrupted
by a murder (or a murder is interrupted by a fancy gala). Envision what your
character is doing and what event might put them on storm-tossed seas—
literally or figuratively.
Forcing your character into action ripples outwards to create new
opportunities and complications.
```

```
THROW OFF THE BOWLINES
That’s it! You’ve decided the truths of the isles, forged powerful factions,
created a character, launched a ship and crew, mapped the local waters,
and envisioned the situation at the start of your story.
If you are new to the Starforged system and want more details on swearing
and undertaking your initial vow, see pages 132–134 of the Starforged
rulebook. Otherwise, it’s time to set sail.
Keep in mind: these exercises were a foundation, not a mandate. If you
decide to change an established aspect of the campaign—or events in your
story reveal their own truth—that’s okay! Keep what you like. Change or
discard what you don’t. Play to see what happens.
Fair weather and following seas, Ironsworn!

SECTION 3

110

## REVEALING THE ISLES

This section contains an array of generators and random tables to help envision  
situations, encounters, and locations among the isles.

USING THE ORACLES

RESULTS BY REGION  
Some location oracles are structured with results organized by the main regions of  
the isles: Myriads, Margins, and Reaches. Check the result for your current location.  
If you are playing in another setting, you can think of those regions as translating to  
Inhabited, Frontier, and Remote.

MULTIPLE RESULTS  
Some oracles provide a recommended number of rolls. For example: @1–2.  
Depending on the situation, you might make multiple rolls at once, or make them over  
time to “peel the onion” and reveal new aspects.

All other tables are assumed to default to a single roll, but some oracles include an  
embedded result that prompts you to make multiple rolls. This is typically shown as  
“Roll twice.” If you get this result, roll twice more on the table and combine those  
results. If you get “Roll twice” yet again, ignore it and redo the roll.

LINKS TO OTHER TABLES  
Oracle answers often prompt you to jump to another oracle. This is  
shown as an arrow symbol with the name(s) of the oracle. For example:

> Island. If you see this prompt, that’s your cue to go to that section or table to reveal  
> more about the encounter or location. If you are reading this rulebook on a digital  
> device, the included page references are clickable.

MIXING AND MATCHING ORACLES  
**The Sundered Isles oracle tables are primarily intended for a seafaring setting,  
but many are flexible enough to incorporate into your Starforged spacefaring  
campaigns or Ironsworn fantasy campaigns—or even other roleplaying games.  
For example, the Faction Oracles (page 176) are useful for a wide variety of  
settings, and the Interlude Scene table (page 228) can help prompt the nature  
of a character-focused downtime scene in any campaign.**

**Inversely, the Starforged oracles are useful for swashbuckling campaigns set  
in the spacefaring realm, helping generate the details of planets, spacegoing  
encounters, strange creatures, and ancient alien vaults.**

**In short, the Sundered Isles oracles provide the essentials for adventures in a  
seafaring world, but feel free to mix and match from other sources to create your  
own perfect oracle kit.**

112 ORACLES

PICK YOUR POISON  
When you Ask the Oracle a question that leads you to this section, consider your  
approach and preferences. For any particular situation, you might have several tables  
to choose from.

Some oracle tables are abstract. For example, the Action oracle (page 116) offers  
single-word prompts. This table can be combined with others to add nuance—such  
as using Theme (page 117) to form a verb/noun combination—but the result still  
relies on your creative interpretation. Deciphering these answers, realizing how they  
connect to situations in your story, experiencing those eureka moments, is part of the  
fun of playing Starforged and Sundered Isles.

Other oracle results are general. They provide room to clarify or expand, but are less  
cryptic than the abstract tables. For example, the Seafaring Peril table (page 128)  
includes prompts for unfortunate events that might befall your ship, but the exact  
nature of each event is left to the players to suss out. You may decide those answers  
yourself, or Ask the Oracle yes/no questions to clarify.

And some oracle tables are specific. A Character Name (page 194), for example.  
Or Overland Details (page 156). The more precise the result, the more flavorful or  
actionable, but the less open to creative interpretation. This is especially true when  
playing in the world of the Sundered Isles, because the oracle tables are keyed to  
the setting. If you are playing in another world, or chose to explore the skyfaring or  
spacefaring realms when you launched your campaign (page 69), you may find  
abstract and general prompts more useful.

With some play time under your belt, you’ll become familiar with the structure of the  
oracles and find your preferred approaches.

OTHER REMINDERS  
The tables in this section are a tool. Use them as you like to help envision the world,  
introduce encounters and events, and move your story forward. Here are a few  
additional tips for making the most of the oracles. See page 291 in the Starforged  
rulebook for more.

```
✴ Use tables as a pick-list: Oracles aren’t just for rolling. You’re free to scan a
table and pick an option that is a good fit. This is particularly true when building
on established facts. However, remember that the generators—particularly for
locations, characters, and ships—are often structured to include a mix of common
and rare answers. For example, an encountered ship might be carrying treasure,
but this is a rare find as defined by the odds of the Cargo table (page 139).
Follow the fiction, treating unusual events and discoveries as special.
✴ Peel the onion: When initially encountering a location, character, or ship, use
the oracle tables for details you would perceive as first impressions, such as the
Character First Look table (page 186). Make a roll or two, envision the result as
appropriate to the situation, make some assumptions to fill in the gaps, and move
on with your story. Then use other tables to reveal new details over time.
✴ Build oracle arrays and campaign elements: An oracle array helps you choose
from among a set of relevant tables, while a campaign elements oracle reveals
the focus of an encounter or situation. See pages 384–385 of the Starforged
rulebook for details.
```

REVEALING THE ISLES 113

## THE CURSED DIE

Are the isles haunted by supernatural forces, monstrous foes, and strange  
technologies? You can introduce these dread aspects when you define your setting  
truths. Or perhaps you will discover them—or wake them—in the course of your story.  
Either way, use the cursed die to reveal the uncanny, horrifying, and chaotic facets of  
your world.

ASK THE (CURSED) ORACLE  
Many random tables in this book are marked  
with a small skull icon: 6. When you use one of  
those tables for inspiration, you may roll a cursed  
die alongside your oracle dice. Like your oracle  
dice, the cursed die is ten-sided, but should be a  
special color or material to distinguish it from the  
oracle dice. Choose a die that evokes an eerie  
quality. A malevolence.

After making your oracle roll, look at the value of  
your cursed die. Is it a 10 (often signified by a 0 or  
00 on a ten-sided die)? If so, your answer is cursed, and you should check the cursed  
version of that table for your answer. The cursed table is often on the same page or  
the next page. If in doubt, a page number next to the small cursed icon shows the way.  
Cursed tables are marked with a large version of the skull icon.

114 ORACLES

### CUSTOMIZING YOUR CURSED EXPERIENCE

Roll the cursed die only when the potential for a cursed answer is wanted and  
appropriate. If you establish that a location or encounter is mundane, omit the cursed  
die when generating new details. If you prefer a setting without supernatural aspects,  
ignore this mechanic altogether. On the other hand, if you encounter a situation where  
a cursed answer is obvious and interesting, go directly to a cursed table.

If you want to further fine-tune the odds of a cursed result to fit the situation, here are  
some options.  
✴ Increase the range of a cursed result by triggering it on 9–10 or 8–10.  
✴ Increase the chance of a cursed result by adding one or two cursed dice to your  
oracle roll. If any die rolls 10, the result is cursed.  
✴ Use a full set of polyhedrals as your cursed dice: D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, and D20  
When adding a cursed die to a roll, choose one. If you roll the highest value on that  
die—for example, 4 on a D4—the result is cursed. Thus, a fewer-sided die increases  
the odds of a cursed result, while a many-sided die makes it less likely.

MORE CURSES  
If you want to give the cursed die more emphasis in your session, use these techniques.

```
✴ Roll a cursed die alongside abstract oracles such as Action and Theme. These
tables don’t have dedicated cursed alternatives, but you can resolve a cursed
result by envisioning the nature of the prompt as frightening or uncanny.
✴ When you Ask the Oracle and use the yes/no table to divine an answer, toss your
cursed die into the mix. If you roll a curse, envision how the answer includes a
dreadful twist.

DESCRIPTOR

When you Ask the Oracle about the nature of a location, discovery, or encounter, roll  
for a Descriptor (above) and a Focus (next page). Together, these tables provide an  
adjective/noun phrase.

Other oracle tables include prompts to check for a Descriptor and Focus (shown as

> Descriptor + Focus). That’s your cue to roll on these tables and interpret the result.

If you face a cost in your travels, such as when you roll a miss as you Undertake an  
Expedition, the Seafaring Peril (pg 128) oracle can help reveal what occurs. If you  
encounter good fortune, such as when you roll a strong hit with a match, the Seafaring  
Opportunity (pg 129) oracle can inspire the nature of this lucky break. Check those  
tables instead of—or in addition to—a seafaring waypoint.

SHIP CONTROLLING FACTION  
If the first impressions of a ship don’t reveal its identity, check the table below. If a  
known faction commands the ship, roll or choose on your faction influence grid (page  
50 ). If it is independent or aligned with an unknown faction, use other tables such  
as Symbol and Mission to help envision its nature, allegiances, and purpose.

SHIP MISSION  
A ship’s faction can reveal its role, such as warship, tradeship, or whaler. If the ship is  
independent, the faction unknown, or if you simply want more detail, use this table.  
Alternatively, use the captain’s goal (page 193) to set the ship’s purpose.

Use this table when surveying a ship’s hold or if coming upon lost or abandoned cargo.  
Roll a number of times as appropriate to the nature of the find. For example, once for  
the hold of a typical warship, or up to four times for a fully loaded tradeship. Ships also  
typically carry basic munitions and provisions for the crew, but this table reveals the

ISLAND ORACLES 143

COASTLINE ASPECTS  
This table reveals topographic features of the nearby island coast. If you roll twice,  
those aspects are combined or close together. When you travel further up the shore of  
a sizable island, you may reroll on this table.

If a result is at odds with the Terrain or Vitality results (see previous pages), envision  
how the island includes both features. For example, shoreline cliffs can surround a flat  
island interior, as with an ancient volcanic caldera. Or an isolated thicket of mangroves  
can grow on the shores of an otherwise desolate island.

If a seaside settlement is in sight, envision how it fits among the coastline and overall  
island terrain.

OVERLAND REGION  
Use this table to reveal the nature of surrounding terrain on an overland expedition.  
Or use the island Terrain and Vitality tables (page 142) to help envision the lay of the  
land, and pick a region from this list based on that result.

You can combine multiple regions (Jungle Highlands, for example) into an oracle array.  
The following pages include Region Landmark tables for each terrain type.

If you face a cost in your travels, such as when you roll a miss as you Undertake an  
Expedition, the Overland Peril (pg 162) oracle can help reveal what occurs. If you  
encounter good fortune, such as when you roll a strong hit with a match, the Overland  
Opportunity (pg 163) oracle can inspire the nature of this lucky break. Check those  
tables instead of—or in addition to—an overland waypoint.

### CHARACTER TOKENS

**Optionally, give an important or reoccurring character an item of personal  
significance. Check the Tokens table on page pg 223 for inspiration. These  
objects would be kept on their person or among their belongings—perhaps even  
locked away as a closely-held secret.**

Check page 195 for the 31–65 results, and page 196 for 66–100.

This table provides pairs of given and family names. When choosing or rolling for a  
character name, select a pair or mix and match from among the options in a row. Given  
and family names can often be reversed, or used independently as stand-alone names.

This table also includes monikers, one to each row. Not all characters have monikers,  
but sailors are often given a nickname by their shipmates, or adopt one of their own.  
Monikers can be used as a stand-alone name (for example, “Redbeard” or “Stormcrow”)  
or paired with a given name or family name (“Crimson Jack” or “Hardtack Hobbs”).  
Roll or select an appropriate moniker as you like.

```
SUMMARY: EXPLORING A SHIPWRECK
Rather than detailing every space within a wreck, focus on the key moments
of what you discover and what threats or obstacles you must overcome.
MAKING PREPARATORY MOVES
The nature of a wreck might suggest preparatory actions. For example, you
might Face Danger to climb to a wreck that is precariously perched atop a
rocky islet, or to safely navigate the interior of a flooded wreck.
EXPLORING A WRECK
If you divert to search a shipwreck in the midst of an expedition, make the
Explore a Waypoint move. Per the move, a strong hit is an opportunity, a
weak hit is an opportunity bound up with a peril, and a miss is an immediate
hardship or threat. Use the Shipwreck Opportunity (page 203) and
Shipwreck Peril (page 203) tables to help envision those outcomes.
A strong hit with a match or a miss with a match as you Explore a Waypoint
can trigger the Make a Discovery or Confront Chaos moves, respectively.
Use the tables within those moves to envision what you find. These are
dramatic, story-changing moments.
INVESTIGATING A WRECK
If you investigate a shipwreck for clues related to a quest, make the Gather
Information move. Use the outcome of the move to help guide the nature of
what you uncover—whether that discovery is favorable or unfavorable. For
inspiration, use the Story Clue table (page 231).
SCAVENGING A WRECK
If you seek to scavenge a shipwreck, make the Resupply move. On a strong
hit, you are successful. A strong hit with a match might offer an opportunity
(in addition to the supplies), while a weak hit or miss can reveal a peril.

Use the Shipwreck Details table (page
202 ) to reveal other aspects of the site.

CAVE ORACLES 205

SUMMARY: EXPLORING A CAVE  
Use the exploration moves (page 242) when you delve a notable cave and want to  
give it focus in your story.

In the twisting waterways of a sea cave (pages 208 – 209 ), you likely travel by boat  
through a world of tide, rock, and shadow. You may be forced to portage over shallows  
and high ground, or even abandon your boat as you struggle through tight spaces or  
desperately navigate completely flooded tunnels.

In an inland cave (pages 210 – 211 ), you follow labyrinthine paths along  
claustrophobic tunnels and through cavernous chambers. Envision the oppressive  
weight of the stone around you, the impenetrable darkness, the unnerving echoes.

Use the Features table to inspire the details of a waypoint, the Peril table when you  
face a cost in your travels, and the Opportunity table if you encounter good fortune.  
But remember these tables are only a complement to your own storytelling choices.

LURKING THREATS  
Time is your enemy within a cave. To emphasize the growing tension of underground  
expeditions, add a tension clock for a lurking threat. When you suffer a cost through  
failure, delay, or inaction, you can advance the clock to show the threat drawing closer.  
Learn more about tension clocks on page 238 of the Starforged rulebook.

The table on the next page includes inspiration for lurking threats, including what signs  
you encounter as the tension clock advances, and what occurs when the clock fills.

REACHING THE HEART  
The heart of a cave is the epicenter of an underground domain. If you are on an  
expedition without a specific mission, the heart can serve as your destination. If you  
are seeking to make progress in a quest, what lies at the heart gives context to the  
final challenges or opportunities you uncover when the expedition is done.

When you Finish an Expedition, envision what lies at the cave’s heart, or use the  
table included with each cave type for inspiration. Once you reach a cave’s heart and  
resolve the expedition, you can Set a Course to shortcut your exit.

SUMMARY: EXPLORING A RUIN  
Use the exploration moves (page 242) to investigate a notable ruin. If you are  
diverting from an overland or seafaring expedition to check out a ruin of minor scale,  
you can Explore a Waypoint to resolve the survey with a single move. For a larger ruin,  
give it a challenge rank as you begin a new expedition. Then, within a ruin, use the  
Features table to inspire the details of a waypoint, the Peril table when you face a cost,  
and the Opportunity table if you encounter good fortune.

UNCOVERING MYSTERIES WITHIN RUINS  
You do not delve into ruins to loot and defile. Instead, you seek to learn more about  
the people who once inhabited a site and the fate that befell them. To that end, your  
progress on an expedition doesn’t just represent the physical spaces you traverse.  
Marking progress also signifies your deepening understanding of that place’s legacy.

To explore the secrets of a mysterious ruin, follow this procedure.

```
✴ When you first mark progress within a ruin, envision a mystery that reveals itself, a
question that prompts further investigation. Check the Ruin Mystery table on page
216 for inspiration, or simply decide the mystery based on whatever quest or
circumstance drew you to this site.
✴ After that, as you reach a waypoint and mark progress, you can envision uncovering
a cipher—a feature, object, or encounter that delivers a new clue. Use the Ruin
Cipher table (page 216) for inspiration of what form it takes. For details of the
clue itself, Ask the Oracle yes/no questions, use Core Oracles (pages 116 – 119 )
for an abstract prompt, or check the Story Clue table (page 231). If the nature of
the cipher is complex or inscrutable, such as a puzzle or cryptic message, make
appropriate moves to reveal or understand the clue. Envision how the clue fits into
the evolving nature of the mystery, while leaving unanswered questions.
✴ When you prepare to Finish an Expedition, consider the nature of the mystery
and the clues you have uncovered, and propose a solution. The outcome of the
progress roll as you Finish an Expedition reveals whether your assumptions are
correct, or if you have been led astray.

A token is an item of personal significance—such as a memento, heirloom, or individual

Use this oracle to help inspire an action for a foe in a fight. When you’re not sure what  
an enemy does next, particularly when they have you in a bad spot, roll on this table  
and interpret the result as appropriate to the nature of the enemy and battleground.

232 ORACLES

Use this table to help envision the nature of damage to your ship or impact on your  
crew. Use this in dramatic situations, such as when suffering a miss with a match  
in a naval fight, or rolling a miss to Withstand Damage. The result will introduce  
complications and looming catastrophes that must be dealt with.

For an initial hit, make the issue bothersome, and roll to learn what aspect of your ship  
is impacted. Then, if you don’t address the problem or suffer another hard hit, step up  
the severity. For example, a weakened mast is splintering, or a shaken crew is breaking.  
You should treat critical damage separately from your ship’s general integrity, requiring  
the “repair any other component or device” option in the Repair move.

You can also roll on this table to reveal damage on a ship other than your own, such as  
when boarding a vessel after a fierce battle. If so, let your oracle roll serve double-duty  
by also indicating the severity. Assume the damage is bothersome on an odd roll, bad  
on an even roll, and critical if you roll a number divisible by 10 (10, 20, 30...).

**Use this table to introduce terrain and environment features for a sea  
battle. This can help enliven the battle with obstacles and opportunities.**

## A–Z MOVES INDEX

Sundered Isles moves ( 1 ) use minor wording changes to better fit the setting  
assumptions, but mostly function identically to their Starforged ( 2 ) counterparts. For  
details on making moves, see Chapter 3 (page 136) of the Starforged rulebook, or  
check the summary for a specific move using the Starforged rulebook page references  
in the table above.

236 MOVES REFERENCE

BEGIN A SESSION  
When you begin a significant session or chapter  
of play, do all of the following.  
✴ Identify or adjust flagged content and Set a Flag.  
✴ Review or recap what happened last session.  
✴ Set the scene by envisioning your character’s  
current situation and intent.  
In addition, you may spotlight a new danger,  
opportunity, or insight. This can include a scene  
hidden from your character’s perspective. If you  
do, envision a brief vignette (you may roll or  
choose on the table below for inspiration). Then,  
all players take +1 momentum as you return to play  
from the viewpoint of your characters.

```
1–10 Flashback reveals an aspect of your
background or nature
11–20 Flashback reveals an aspect of another
character, place, or faction
21–30Influential character or faction is
introduced or given new detail
31–40Seemingly unrelated situations are
shown to be connected
41–50External factors create new danger,
urgency, or importance for a quest
51–60Important character is put in danger or
suffers a misadventure
61–70 Key location is made unsafe or
becomes mired in conflict
71–80 Unexpected return of an enemy or threat
81–90Peril lies ahead or lurks just out of view
91–100Unforeseen aid is on the way or
within reach
```

SET A FLAG  
When you identify situations or topics you  
don’t want to include, don’t want to envision  
in detail, or otherwise may need mindfulness  
when approaching, that content is now flagged.  
When you encounter content flagged as something  
to approach mindfully, pause to consider or discuss  
its role in your story. When you come across  
flagged content that you would rather adjust or  
omit, Change Your Fate.

```
CHANGE YOUR FATE
When you encounter flagged content, reject
an oracle, resist a consequence, or otherwise
need to shift your circumstances within the
game for your comfort or enjoyment, pause
and identify what needs to be changed. Choose as
many options as appropriate.
✴ Reframe: This didn’t happen the way you first
thought. Envision the moment from another
perspective in a way that diminishes or changes
the content.
```

✴ (^) Refocus: This is not the most important thing  
happening right now. Envision how the spotlight  
shifts to change the focus.  
✴ (^) Replace: This happens but with a small  
adjustment. Switch out an element and envision  
how this new detail changes the scenario.  
✴ (^) Redirect: Adjust the trajectory to involve a  
helping hand. Envision how another person or  
party becomes involved.  
✴ (^) Reshape: The situation changes completely.  
Envision what happened instead.  
TAKE A BREAK  
When you resolve a progress move or complete  
an intense scenario, take a few deep breaths  
and take some time to attend to the needs of your  
body. Reflect on what just happened and how it  
made you feel. Then, choose one.  
✴ (^) Move on: Continue the session. You or an ally  
may add +1 on the next move (not a progress  
move), bolstered by your reflection and past  
experiences.  
✴ Stop for now: End a Session.  
END A SESSION  
When you end a significant session or chapter  
of play, reflect on the events of the game and  
identify any missed opportunities to mark progress.  
✴ If you strengthened your ties to a connection,  
Develop Your Relationship.  
✴ (^) If you moved forward on a quest, Reach a  
Milestone.  
If there is a quest, connection, or other situation  
you would like to give focus in your next session,  
make note of it and take +1 momentum.

## SESSION MOVES

SESSION MOVES 237

FACE DANGER  
When you attempt something risky or react to  
an imminent threat, envision your action and roll.  
If you act...

✴ (^) With speed, mobility, or agility: Roll +edge  
✴ (^) With resolve, command, or sociability: Roll +heart  
✴ (^) With strength, endurance, or aggression:  
Roll +iron  
✴ With deception, stealth, or trickery: Roll +shadow

On a miss, you fail, or a momentary success is  
undermined by a dire turn of events. Pay the Price.  
SECURE AN ADVANTAGE  
When you assess a situation, make  
preparations, or attempt to gain leverage,  
envision your action and roll. If you act...  
✴ With speed, mobility, or agility: Roll +edge  
✴ With resolve, command, or sociability: Roll +heart  
✴ With strength, endurance, or aggression:  
Roll +iron  
✴ (^) With deception, stealth, or trickery: Roll +shadow  
✴ (^) With expertise, focus, or observation: Roll +wits

On a weak hit, choose one.  
✴ Take +2 momentum  
✴ Add +1 on your next move (not a progress move)  
On a miss, you fail or your assumptions betray  
you. Pay the Price.  
GATHER INFORMATION

investigation, analyze evidence, or do  
research, roll +wits.  
On a strong hit, you discover something helpful  
and specific. The path you must follow or action  
you must take to make progress is made clear.  
Envision what you learn. Then, take +2 momentum.  
On a weak hit, the information provides new  
insight, but also complicates your quest. Envision  
what you discover. Then, take +1 momentum.  
On a miss, your investigation unearths a dire threat  
or reveals an unwelcome truth that undermines  
your quest. Pay the Price.  
COMPEL  
When you try to persuade someone or make  
them an offer, envision your approach. If you...  
✴ (^) Charm, pacify, encourage, or barter: Roll +heart  
✴ Threaten or incite: Roll +iron  
✴ Lie or swindle: Roll +shadow  
On a strong hit, they’ll do what you want or agree  
to your conditions. Take +1 momentum.  
On a weak hit, as above, but their agreement  
comes with a demand or complication. Envision  
their counteroffer.  
On a miss, they refuse or make a demand that  
costs you greatly. Pay the Price.

## ADVENTURE MOVES

238 MOVES REFERENCE

```
The adventure moves
encompass broadly
useful actions to
overcome obstacles,
reinforce your position,
conduct investigations,
influence others,
and support your
fellow protagonists.
When you face a peril
or try to gain leverage,
and another move
does not apply, you’ll
likely find your answer
among these moves.
```

AID YOUR ALLY  
When you act in direct support of an ally, envision how you aid  
them. Then, Secure an Advantage or Gain Ground to take action. If  
you score a hit, they (instead of you) take the benefits of the move.  
If you Gain Ground and score a strong hit, you are both in control. On  
a weak hit, your ally is in control but you are in a bad spot.

CHECK YOUR GEAR  
When you check to see if you have a specific helpful item or  
resource, roll +supply.  
On a strong hit, you have it, and are ready to act. Take +1 momentum.  
On a weak hit, you have it, but must choose one.  
✴ Your supply is diminished: Sacrifice Resources (-1)  
✴ It’s not quite right, and causes a complication or delay: Lose  
Momentum (-2)  
On a miss, you don’t have it and the situation grows more perilous.  
Pay the Price.

ADVENTURE MOVES 239

## QUEST MOVES

SWEAR AN IRON VOW  
When you swear to complete a quest,  
write your vow and give it a rank. Then, roll  
+heart. If you swear this vow to a connection,  
add +1; if you share a bond, add +2.  
On a strong hit, you are emboldened and it is  
clear what you must do next. Take +2 momentum.  
On a weak hit, you are determined but begin  
your quest with more questions than answers.  
Take +1 momentum, and envision what you do to  
find a path forward.  
On a miss, you must overcome a significant  
obstacle before you begin your quest. Envision  
what stands in your way.

REACH A MILESTONE  
When you make headway in your quest by  
doing any of the following...

## CONNECTION MOVES

MAKE A CONNECTION  
When you search out a new relationship or  
give focus to an existing relationship (not an  
ally or companion), roll +heart.  
On a strong hit, you create a connection. Give  
them a role and rank. Whenever your connection  
aids you on a move closely associated with their  
role, add +1 and take +1 momentum on a hit.  
On a weak hit, as above, but this connection  
comes with a complication or cost. Envision what  
they reveal or demand.  
On a miss, you don’t make a connection and the  
situation worsens. Pay the Price.

DEVELOP YOUR  
RELATIONSHIP  
When you reinforce your relationship with a  
connection by doing any of the following...  
✴ swearing a vow to undertake a perilous quest in  
their service  
✴ completing a quest to their benefit  
✴ leveraging their help in desperate circumstances  
✴ giving them something of worth  
✴ sharing a profound moment  
✴ standing with them against hardship  
✴ overcoming a test of your relationship  
...you may mark progress per the rank of the  
connection.  
If you already share a bond with the connection,  
do not mark progress. Instead, roll +their rank to  
learn the impact on your legacy: troublesome=+1;  
dangerous=+2; formidable=+3; extreme=+4;  
epic=+5. On a strong hit, mark 2 ticks on your  
bonds legacy track. On a strong hit with a  
match, you may also envision how recent events  
bolstered your connection’s standing and raise  
their rank by one (if not already epic). On a weak  
hit, take +2 momentum. On a miss, take no  
lasting benefit.

```
TEST YOUR RELATIONSHIP
When your relationship with a connection
is tested through conflict, betrayal, or
circumstance, roll +heart. If you share a bond,
add +1.
On a strong hit, Develop Your Relationship.
On a weak hit, Develop Your Relationship, but
also envision a demand or complication as a fallout
of this test.
On a miss, or if you have no interest in maintaining
this relationship, choose one.
✴ Lose the connection: Envision how this impacts
you and Pay the Price.
```

✴ (^) Prove your loyalty: Envision what you offer or  
what they demand, and Swear an Iron Vow  
(formidable or greater) to see it done. Until  
you complete the quest, take no benefit for the  
connection. If you refuse or fail, the connection  
is permanently undone.  
FORGE A BOND  
**Progress Move**  
When your relationship with a connection  
is ready to evolve, roll the challenge dice and  
compare to your progress.  
On a strong hit, you now share a bond. Mark  
a reward on your bonds legacy track per the  
connection’s rank: troublesome=1 tick; dangerous=2  
ticks; formidable=1 box; extreme=2 boxes; epic=3  
boxes. Any allies who share this connection also  
mark the reward. Then, choose one.  
✴ Bolster their influence: When they aid you on a  
move closely associated with their role, add +2  
instead of +1.  
✴ Expand their influence: Give them a second role.  
When they aid you on a move closely associated  
with either role, add +1 and take +1 momentum  
on a hit.  
On a weak hit, as above, but they ask something  
more of you first. To gain the bond and the legacy  
reward, envision the nature of the request, and do  
it (or Swear an Iron Vow to see it done).  
On a miss, they reveal a motivation or background  
that puts you at odds. If you recommit to this  
relationship, roll both challenge dice, take the  
lowest value, and clear that number of progress  
boxes. Then, raise the connection’s rank by one  
(if not already epic).

aspect of this place. Envision what you encounter.  
Then, take +1 momentum.  
On a miss, you encounter an immediate hardship  
or threat, and must Pay the Price. On a miss with a  
match, you may instead Confront Chaos.  
FINISH AN EXPEDITION  
**Progress Move**  
When your expedition comes to an end, roll the  
challenge dice and compare to your progress.

formidable=1 box; extreme=2 boxes; epic=3  
boxes. Any allies who shared this expedition also  
mark the reward.  
On a weak hit, as above, but you face an  
unforeseen complication at the end of your  
expedition. Make the legacy reward one rank lower  
(none for a troublesome expedition), and envision  
what you encounter.  
On a miss, your destination is lost to you, or  
you come to understand the true nature or cost  
of the expedition. Envision what happens and  
choose one.  
✴ (^) Abandon the expedition: Envision the cost of this  
setback and Pay the Price.

244 MOVES REFERENCE

```
In a fight, your
character is in one
of two positions:
in control or in
a bad spot.
If you are in control,
you can make
proactive moves
such as Gain Ground
and Strike. When in
a bad spot, you must
make reactive moves
such as React Under
Fire and Clash. The
outcome of a combat
move will describe
your current position.
When you make a
move that doesn’t
define your position
(such as a suffer
move), follow these
guidelines:
On a strong hit, you
are in control
```

```
On a weak hit or miss,
you are in a bad spot.

TAKE DECISIVE ACTION  
**Progress Move**  
When you seize an objective in a fight, envision how you take  
decisive action. Then, roll the challenge dice and compare to  
your progress.  
If you are in control, check the result as normal. If you are in a bad  
spot, count a strong hit without a match as a weak hit, and a weak  
hit as a miss.  
On a strong hit, you prevail. Take +1 momentum. If any objectives  
remain and the fight continues, you are in control.  
On a weak hit, you achieve your objective, but not without cost.  
Roll on the table below or choose one. If the fight continues, you  
are in a bad spot.

```
1–40 It’s worse than you thought: Make a suffer move (-2)
41–52Victory is short-lived: A new peril or foe appears
53–64You face collateral damage: Something is lost, damaged,
or broken
65–76Others pay the price: Someone else suffers the cost
77–88 Others won’t forget: You are marked for vengeance
89–100It gets complicated: The true nature of a foe or objective
is revealed
```

On a miss, you are defeated or your objective is lost. Pay the Price.

FACE DEFEAT  
When you abandon or are deprived of an objective, envision the  
consequence of this failure, clear the objective, and Pay the Price.  
If the fight continues, you may create a new objective and give it a  
rank to represent the changing situation. If any objectives remain, the  
fight continues and you are in a bad spot.

BATTLE  
When you fight a battle and it happens in a blur, envision your  
objective and roll. If you primarily...  
✴ Fight at range, or using your speed and the environment to your  
advantage: Roll +edge.

✴ (^) Fight depending on your courage, leadership, or companions:  
Roll +heart.  
✴ (^) Fight in close to overpower your foe: Roll +iron.  
✴ (^) Fight using trickery to befuddle your foe: Roll +shadow.

When you are delayed or disadvantaged, suffer  
-1 momentum for a minor setback, -2 for a serious  
setback, or -3 for a major setback.  
When your momentum is at its minimum (-6) and  
you must suffer -momentum, choose one.

✴ (^) Envision how the price is paid and apply the cost  
to a different suffer move.  
✴ Envision how this undermines your progress on  
a vow, expedition, connection, or combat. Then,  
clear 1 unit of progress on that track per its rank:  
troublesome=3 boxes; dangerous=2 boxes;  
formidable=1 box; extreme=2 ticks; epic=1 tick.  
ENDURE HARM  
When you face physical injury, fatigue, or  
illness, suffer -1 health for minor harm, -2 for  
serious harm, or -3 for major harm. If your health

Then, if your health is 0 or you choose to resist the  
harm, roll +health or +iron, whichever is higher.  
On a strong hit, choose one.  
✴ (^) Shake it off: If you are not wounded, take +1 health  
✴ (^) Embrace the pain: Take +1 momentum  
On a weak hit, if you are not wounded, you may  
Lose Momentum (-1) in exchange for +1 health.  
Otherwise, press on.  
On a miss, it’s worse than you thought. Suffer  
an additional -1 health or Lose Momentum (-2). If  
your health is 0, you must also mark wounded or  
permanently harmed, or roll on the table below.  
1–10 You suffer mortal harm. Face Death.  
11–20 You are dying. Within an hour or two,  
you must Heal and raise your health  
above 0, or Face Death.

to ongoing harm, Face Death.  
36–50You are reeling. If you engage in  
any vigorous activity before taking a  
breather, roll on this table again (before  
resolving the other move).  
51–100You are still standing.  
ENDURE STRESS  
When you face mental strain, shock, or despair,  
suffer -1 spirit for minor stress, -2 for serious stress,

Lose Momentum (-1) in exchange for +1 spirit.  
Otherwise, press on.  
On a miss, it’s worse than you thought. Suffer  
an additional -1 spirit or Lose Momentum (-2).  
If your spirit is 0, you must also mark shaken or  
traumatized, or roll on the table below.  
1–10 You are overwhelmed. Face Desolation.  
11–25 You give up. Forsake Your Vow.  
26–50You give in to fear or compulsion, and  
act against your better instincts.  
51–100You persevere.  
COMPANION TAKES A HIT  
When your companion faces physical  
hardship, they suffer -1 health for minor harm,  
-2 for serious harm, or -3 for major harm. If your  
companion’s health is 0, Lose Momentum equal to  
any remaining harm.  
Then, if their health is 0 or you choose to test their  
resilience, roll +your companion’s health.  
On a strong hit, your companion rallies. Give them  
+1 health.  
On a weak hit, if your companion’s health is not  
0, you may Lose Momentum (-1) and give them +1  
health. Otherwise, they press on.  
On a miss, it’s worse than you thought. They suffer  
an additional -1 health or you Lose Momentum (-2).  
If your companion’s health is 0, they are out of  
action until given aid. If their health is 0 and you  
rolled a miss with a match on this move, they are  
dead or destroyed; discard the asset.  
246 MOVES REFERENCE

```
When you bear the
brunt of a failed action
or make a concession,
the suffer moves
help resolve the
cost. These moves
are typically made
when you must Pay
the Price and face a
hardship that directly
impacts your well-
being and readiness,
or as prompted by
a move or asset.
```

```
If you mark an impact
as an outcome of a
suffer move, reduce
your max momentum
and momentum reset.
Max Momentum
Your max momentum
is reduced by 1 for
each marked impact.
For example, one
impact will drop your
max momentum to
+9. Three impacts
will reduce it to +7.
Momentum Reset
If you have one
marked impact, your
momentum reset is
+1 (instead of +2).
If you have more than
one marked impact,
your momentum reset
is 0 (instead of +2).
```

SACRIFICE RESOURCES  
When you lose or consume resources, suffer -1 supply for a minor  
loss, -2 for a serious loss, or -3 for a major loss.  
If your supply is exhausted (reduced to 0), mark unprepared. When  
you suffer a loss of resources while unprepared, envision how this  
causes you hardship and apply the cost to a different suffer move.

WITHSTAND DAMAGE  
When your vehicle faces a damaging situation or environment,  
suffer -1 integrity for minor damage, -2 for serious damage, or -3 for  
major damage. If your integrity is 0, Lose Momentum equal to any  
remaining damage.  
Then, if your integrity is 0 or you choose to resist the damage, roll  
+integrity.  
On a strong hit, choose one.

✴ (^) Damage control: If your vehicle is not battered, take +1 integrity  
✴ (^) Hold fast : Take +1 momentum  
On a weak hit, if your vehicle is not battered, you may Lose  
Momentum (-1) in exchange for +1 integrity. Otherwise, carry on.  
On a miss, it’s worse than you thought. Suffer an additional -1  
integrity or Lose Momentum (-2). If your integrity is 0, also suffer a  
cost according to the vehicle type.  
✴ (^) Command vehicle: Mark the vehicle as battered or cursed, mark  
a module as broken, destroy a broken module by discarding it,  
or roll on the table below. If the command vehicle is destroyed or  
sunk, Overcome Destruction.  
✴ Support vehicle: Mark the vehicle as battered or roll on the table  
below. If the vehicle is destroyed or sunk, discard the asset.  
✴ Incidental vehicle: Roll on the table below.  
1–10 Immediate catastrophic destruction or sinking. You and your  
allies must Endure Harm or Face Death, as appropriate.  
11–25 Destruction or sinking is imminent and unavoidable. All  
aboard must find a way to safety.  
26–40Destruction or sinking is imminent, but can be averted if  
you Repair your vehicle and raise its integrity above 0. If  
you fail, see 11–25.  
41–55You cannot Repair this vehicle until you Resupply and  
obtain crucial parts or materials. If you roll this result  
again prior to that, see 11–25.  
56–70The vehicle is crippled. To get it back in action, you must  
Repair and raise its integrity above 0.  
71–85 Those aboard bear the brunt of the damage. You and  
your allies must make the Endure Harm, Endure Stress, or  
Companion Takes a Hit move, suffering a serious (-2) cost.  
86–95You’ve lost gear, cargo, or provisions. Sacrifice Resources (-2).  
96–100Against all odds, the vehicle holds together.  
SUFFER MOVES 247

SOJOURN  
When you spend time recovering within a  
community, roll +heart.  
On a strong hit, this is a safe refuge. You and  
your allies may each choose two recover moves:  
Heal, Hearten, Repair, or Resupply. Instead of  
rolling, assume an automatic strong hit for each. An  
individual move can be taken more than once.  
On a weak hit, as above, but time is short or  
resources are strained. You and your allies each  
make one recover move instead of two, with no  
more than three moves total among the group.  
On a miss, choose one.  
✴ The community needs your help, or makes a  
costly demand in exchange for safe harbor.  
Envision what they ask of you. If you do it, or  
Swear an Iron Vow to see it done, resolve this  
move as a strong hit.  
✴ You find no relief, and the situation grows worse.  
Pay the Price.

HEAL  
When you receive medical care or provide  
treatment, envision the situation and roll. If you...

✴ (^) Receive treatment from someone (not an ally):  
Roll +iron  
✴ Mend your own wounds: Roll +iron or +wits,

✴ Obtain treatment for a companion: Roll +heart  
✴ Provide care: Roll +wits  
On a strong hit, the care is helpful. If you (or the  
ally under your care) are wounded, clear the impact  
and take or give +2 health. Otherwise, take or give  
+3 health.  
On a weak hit, as above, but the recovery costs extra  
time or resources. Choose one: Lose Momentum (-2)  
or Sacrifice Resources (-2).  
On a miss, the aid is ineffective and the situation  
worsens. Pay the Price.  
HEARTEN  
When you socialize, share intimacy, or find a  
moment of peace, roll +heart.  
On a strong hit, you find companionship or  
comfort and your spirit is strengthened. If you  
are shaken, clear the impact and take +1 spirit.  
Otherwise, take +2 spirit. If you make this move as  
you Sojourn, take +1 more.  
On a weak hit, as above, but this indulgence is  
fleeting. Envision an interruption, complication, or  
inner conflict. Then, Lose Momentum (-1).  
On a miss, you take no comfort and the situation  
worsens. Pay the Price.  
RESUPPLY  
When you attempt to bolster your readiness,  
envision the opportunity and your approach.  
If you...  
✴ Barter or make an appeal: Roll +heart  
✴ (^) Threaten or seize: Roll +iron  
✴ (^) Steal or swindle: Roll +shadow  
✴ (^) Scavenge or craft: Roll +wits  
✴ (^) Gear up from your ship’s stores: Roll +supply  
(hold)  
On a strong hit, choose one.  
✴ If you are unprepared, clear the impact and take  
+1 supply. Otherwise, take +2 supply.  
✴ (^) If you are in need of a specific item, resource,  
or service that can reasonably be obtained, you  
acquire it. Take +1 momentum.  
On a weak hit, as above, but you must first deal  
with a cost, complication, or demand. Envision the  
nature of this obstacle.  
On a miss, you gain nothing and the situation  
worsens. Pay the Price.

## RECOVER MOVES

248 MOVES REFERENCE

```
When you Repair and
score a hit, you gain
repair points. This is
a limited resource
used only within the
scope of the move to
prioritize and make
repairs. The amount of
repair points you earn
varies according to
the situation and the
outcome of the move,
per the included table.
Here’s a summary
of those situations.
At a Facility
Serviced by a
dockyard or other
facility—not making
your own repairs.
At Anchor
Making your own
repairs while
docked, anchored,
or encamped—with
sufficient time to
give the repairs
proper attention.
Underway
Making your own
repairs while
traveling or under
time pressure.
Under Fire
Making your own
repairs in a crisis, such
as during combat,
while navigating
a hazardous
environment,
under extreme time
pressure, or dealing
with life-and-death
repair issues.
```

REPAIR  
When you make or obtain repairs to your vehicles, modules,  
mechanical companions, or other equipment, envision the  
situation and roll. If you...

✴ (^) Make your own repairs, or direct companions or crewmembers to  
make repairs: Roll +wits  
✴ Obtain repair services at a facility: Roll +heart  
On a hit, you gain repair points as appropriate to the situation, per  
the table below. Additionally, if you make your own repairs, you may  
Sacrifice Resources (hold) and exchange each -1 of supply for 1 extra  
repair point (up to 3 points).  
Situation Strong Hit Weak Hit  
At a facility 7 points 5 points  
At anchor 4 points 2 points  
Underway 3 points 1 points  
Under fire 2 points 0 points  
Spend repair points as follows. Unused points are discarded.  
✴ (^) Clear the battered impact on a vehicle: 2 points  
✴ (^) Fix one broken module: 2 points  
✴ (^) Take +1 integrity on a vehicle: 1 point  
✴ (^) Take +1 health for a mechanical companion: 1 point  
✴ (^) Repair any other component or device: 3 points  
✴ (^) Repair any other equipment or device, but with a complication or  
malfunction: 2 points  
On a miss, the repairs are not made and the situation worsens.  
Pay the Price.  
RECOVER MOVES 249

FACE DEATH  
When you encounter a situation where death  
is an immediate and unavoidable outcome, you  
are dead. When you are instead brought to the  
brink of death with a chance for recovery or  
redemption, roll +heart.  
On a strong hit, you are cast back into the  
mortal world.  
On a weak hit, choose one.

✴ (^) You die, but not before making a noble sacrifice.  
Envision your final moments.  
✴ There is more to be done. Envision what is  
revealed or asked of you at death’s door, and  
Swear an Iron Vow to complete an extreme  
quest. You return to the mortal world and must  
mark doomed. When you complete the death-  
bound quest, clear the impact.  
On a miss, you are dead.  
FACE DESOLATION  
When you are brought to the brink of  
desolation, roll +heart.  
On a strong hit, you resist and press on.  
On a weak hit, choose one.  
✴ (^) Your spirit breaks, but not before you make a  
noble sacrifice. Envision your final moments.  
✴ You see a vision of a dreaded event coming  
to pass. Envision that dark future, and Swear  
an Iron Vow to prevent it through an extreme  
quest. You return to your senses and must  
mark tormented. When you complete the soul-  
bound quest, clear the impact.  
On a miss, you succumb to despair or horror and  
are lost.  
OVERCOME DESTRUCTION  
**Progress Move**  
When your command vehicle is destroyed or  
irrevocably lost, you must discard the asset, along  
with any modules and docked support vehicles.  
If you survive, you may use your connections to  
replace some of what was lost. To learn the cost,  
roll the challenge dice and compare to the progress  
on your bonds legacy track.  
On a strong hit, you may call in a favor. This comes  
without conditions.  
On a weak hit, you owe someone. You must mark  
indebted and Swear an Iron Vow to complete an  
extreme quest in their service. When you complete  
the duty-bound quest, clear the impact.  
On a miss, as with the weak hit result, but this  
quest is against your nature, forces you to Forsake  
Your Vow on another quest, or is in the service of  
an enemy.  
If you accept the cost, take 1 experience for every  
marked ability on the discarded assets (minimum 3  
experience). Spend this experience only on a new  
command vehicle, modules, and support vehicles.

## THRESHOLD MOVES

250 MOVES REFERENCE

```
EARN EXPERIENCE
When you fill a box (four ticks) on any legacy
track, take 2 experience. This experience may be
spent when you Advance.
Once you completely fill the tenth box on any
legacy track, clear that track. You may start again
marking progress on the cleared track, but earn
experience at a reduced rate of 1 experience
(instead of 2) for each filled progress box. If you
make a progress roll against this track, resolve
the outcome as if at 10 progress.
```

```
ADVANCE
When you develop your abilities, improve
your resources, gain a reward, or boost your
influence, you may spend 3 experience to add
a new asset, or 2 experience to upgrade an
asset. Choose from the following categories as
appropriate to your focus and opportunities.
```

✴ (^) Module: Upgrade your command vehicle  
✴ (^) Support Vehicle: Acquire or improve a  
secondary vehicle  
✴ Path: Bolster your personal capabilities or  
follow a new calling  
✴ (^) Companion: Gain or improve a trusted helper  
✴ (^) Deed: Learn from your experiences or build a  
legacy  
CONTINUE A LEGACY  
**Progress Move**  
When you retire from your life as Ironsworn, or  
succumb to death or desolation, you may create  
a new character in your established setting. If you  
do, roll the challenge dice and compare to each  
of the former character’s legacy tracks: quests,  
bonds, and discoveries (one roll per track).  
For each strong hit, choose one from below, or  
one from the weak hit or miss options.  
✴ Follow their path: Take one path or companion  
asset from the former character (at no cost),  
including any marked abilities.  
✴ Share a connection: Take one connection from  
the former character, including any accrued  
progress or bond benefits.  
✴ Accept an inheritance: Take the former  
character’s command vehicle and one module  
or support vehicle (at no cost), including any  
marked abilities.  
For each weak hit, choose one from below, or one  
from the miss options.  
✴ See it through: Choose one of the former  
character’s unfinished quests, and Swear an  
Iron Vow (with an automatic strong hit) to see it  
done. You may immediately mark up to half their  
earned progress (round down) on this quest.  
✴ Rebuild a connection: Name one of the former  
character’s connections, and envision how  
time or circumstances have changed them in  
a dramatic way. When you Make a Connection  
with them, take an automatic strong hit and  
mark two ticks on your bonds legacy track.  
✴ (^) Explore familiar ground: Name a location that  
was meaningful to the former character. When  
you first visit that place, envision how it has  
changed or is endangered. Then, mark two ticks  
on your discoveries legacy track.  
For each miss, choose one.  
✴ Deal with the aftermath: Envision how one of  
your former character’s foes has gained power  
or influence.  
✴ (^) Switch loyalties: Envision how you begin in  
opposition to your former character’s beliefs,  
goals, or allegiances.  
✴ (^) Open Pandora’s Box: Envision how an  
advancement or discovery has unleashed  
unexpectedly dire consequences.

ASK THE ORACLE  
When you seek to resolve questions, reveal details, discover  
locations, determine how other characters respond, or trigger  
encounters or events, you may...

✴ (^) Draw a conclusion: Decide the answer based on the most interesting  
and obvious result.  
✴ Spark an idea: Use an oracle table or other random prompt.  
✴ Ask a yes/no question: Decide the odds of a yes, and roll on the  
table below to check the answer.  
✴ (^) Pick two: Envision two options. Rate one as likely, and roll on the  
table below to see if it is true. If not, it is the other.  
**Odds The answer is yes if you roll...**  
Small Chance 10 or less  
Unlikely 25 or less  
50/50 50 or less  
Likely 75 or less  
Almost Certain 90 or less  
On a match, envision an extreme result or twist.  
In solo or co-op play,  
Ask the Oracle when  
you have a question  
about the outcome of  
an action, an aspect  
of your setting, or  
a narrative event.  
A match on your  
oracle dice when  
rolling on the yes/  
no table indicates  
an extreme result,  
interesting twist, or  
dramatic complication.  
In guided play, the  
guide is the oracle.  
When the players  
pose a question or  
a situation creates  
uncertainty, the  
guide can decide  
an answer, Ask the  
Oracle for inspiration,  
or turn the question  
back to the players.

PAY THE PRICE  
When you suffer the outcome of an action, choose one.

✴ (^) Make the most obvious negative outcome happen.  
✴ (^) Ask the Oracle for inspiration. Interpret the answer as a hardship  
or complication appropriate to the situation.  
✴ Roll on the table below. If the result doesn’t fit the situation,  
roll again.  
1–2 A trusted individual or community acts against you  
3–4 An individual or community you care about is exposed  
to danger  
5–7 You encounter signs of a looming threat  
8–10 You create an opportunity for an enemy  
11–14 You face a tough choice  
15–18 You face the consequences of an earlier choice  
19–22A surprising development complicates your quest  
23–26You are separated from something or someone  
27–32Your action causes collateral damage or has an  
unintended effect  
33–38Something of value is lost or destroyed  
39–44The environment or terrain introduces a new hazard

if alone)  
57–62Your equipment or vehicle fails you  
63–68Your vehicle suffers damage  
69–74You waste resources  
75–81 You are harmed  
82–88You are stressed  
89–95You are delayed or put at a disadvantage  
96–100Roll twice  
Make the Pay the Price  
move when prompted  
by another move  
due to a negative  
outcome, or when  
the current situation  
naturally leads to a  
cost through your  
choices or actions.  
To determine the cost  
when you Pay the  
Price, you may decide  
the outcome yourself,  
Ask the Oracle for  
insight, or roll on the  
included table. In  
guided play, look to  
the guide for a ruling.  
The price you pay  
can be a narrative  
consequence that  
complicates things  
for your character,  
or a combination  
of a narrative and  
mechanical cost.  
But be mindful of  
pacing; don’t drop  
the hammer after one  
bad roll. Start with  
lesser complications  
and consequences  
appropriate to the  
situation, then apply  
escalating danger  
and hardships if the  
failures stack up.  
FATE MOVES 253

BEGIN THE SCENE  
**When you face an extended or complex  
challenge** , name your objective and choose a rank  
as appropriate to the situation.

✴ (^) You have a clear advantage: Troublesome  
✴ (^) You are ready to act: Dangerous  
✴ (^) You are unprepared or outmatched: Formidable  
Then, activate a 4-segment tension clock and Face  
Danger or Secure an Advantage to take action.  
FACE DANGER

progress, but also encounter a complication or  
setback. Envision what occurs and fill a clock  
segment.  
On a miss, you fail, or a momentary success is  
undermined by a dramatic turn of events. Fill a  
clock segment and Pay the Price. On a miss with  
a match, fill two segments and Pay the Price.  
SECURE AN ADVANTAGE  
(SCENE CHALLENGE)  
When you assess a situation, make  
preparations, or attempt to gain leverage within  
a scene challenge, envision your action and roll. If  
you act...

with a match, fill two segments and Pay the Price.  
FINISH THE SCENE  
**Progress Move**  
When the scene challenge tension clock or  
progress track is filled, or when events lead to  
the scene’s conclusion, roll the challenge dice  
and compare to your progress.  
On a strong hit, you achieve your objective  
unconditionally.  
On a weak hit, you succeed, but not without cost.  
You must Pay the Price. Make this a minor cost  
relative to the scope of the scene.  
On a miss, you fail or are undermined by a dire turn  
of events. Pay the Price.

## SCENE CHALLENGES

A scene challenge is an optional structured approach for resolving an extended non-  
combat scene against a threat or other characters, particularly when a time limit or  
looming danger adds extra urgency. Scene challenges use a troublesome, dangerous,  
or formidable progress track countered by a tension clock with four segments.

Make the Begin the Scene move to start the challenge. To act within the scene, use  
the alternative versions of Face Danger and Secure an Advantage shown here. When  
the clock or progress track is filled, or the narrative guides you to a conclusion, Finish  
the Scene.

254 MOVES REFERENCE

## QUICK REFERENCE

### “ADD +X”

Add this value to your action die. For  
most action rolls, your action die + stat

- adds is your final action score. If you  
    gain multiple prompts to “add +x” for a  
    single action, those bonuses stack.

“MARK PROGRESS”  
When a move or asset ability prompts  
you to mark progress, check the rank of  
the challenge and fill in the appropriate  
number of boxes or ticks in your  
progress track.

If a move prompts you to mark progress,  
and you have an asset ability that also  
instructs you to mark progress for that  
action, you may mark progress again.  
In other words, “mark progress” stacks.  
Every instance of progress earned within  
the same action allows you to mark the  
appropriate number of boxes or ticks  
per the rank of the challenge.

“MARK PROGRESS TWICE”  
If a move or asset ability prompts you to  
“mark progress twice,” mark double the  
number of ticks or boxes per the rank  
of the challenge. For example, marking  
progress twice on a troublesome  
challenge would mean marking 6 boxes  
(instead of 3). Any additional instances  
of “mark progress” in the same action  
stack on top of this reward.

“ONCE PER SITUATION”  
A “situation” includes the entirety of  
an encounter, fight, or attempt to  
overcome an obstacle. When an asset  
ability is limited to “once per situation,”  
it cannot be used again without a  
meaningful change in your circumstance  
and intention.

For a more complete glossary of terms,  
see page 388 of the Starforged rulebook.

### “PROGRESS MOVE”

```
This is a special move to resolve a
goal or challenge. When you make a
progress move, tally the number of
filled boxes on your progress track as
your progress score. Only add fully
filled boxes (those with four ticks).
Then, roll your challenge dice, compare
to your progress score, and resolve a
strong hit, weak hit, or miss as normal.
You may not burn momentum on a
progress move and are not affected by
negative momentum. In addition, asset
abilities do not affect progress rolls
unless they define a specific benefit for
a progress move.
“ROLL +[STAT/METER/OTHER]”
This is the basic action roll. Most action
rolls are made by adding the value of
a stat to your action die. Moves may
indicate a stat you should use, such as
“roll +iron.” If it doesn’t, or gives you a
choice, use the stat that best fits the
situation and your approach. Some
moves and asset abilities will prompt
you to use a condition meter or other
value instead of a stat.
“TAKE +X”
Add this number to the indicated meter.
For example, “take +2 momentum” tells
you to add 2 to your momentum meter.
Unless stated otherwise, asset bonuses
are in addition to the benefits you
gain as part of a move. If you take +2
momentum as a move outcome, and you
are aided by an asset that tells you to
“take +1 momentum,” you gain a total of
+3 momentum.
“WHEN YOU...”
This is the move trigger. When you do
this thing, or encounter this situation,
make the move.
