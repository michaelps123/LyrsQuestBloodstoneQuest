##### C "Select **two** of the key issues identified in the provided scenario. Recommend a different leadership style for _each_ issue, and explain how your chosen leadership style effectively addresses the issues. Leadership styles can include, but are not limited to, transformational, servant, spiritual, autocratic, or authentic leadership."
1. **Resistance to Change**: To address resistance to change, I would adopt a **transformational leadership style**. This style focuses on inspiring and motivating the team by clearly communicating a compelling vision of the end goal and how achieving it benefits both the team and the organization. By fostering trust, encouraging innovation, and emphasizing the value of the change, a transformational leader can help overcome resistance, align the team with the shared vision, and build enthusiasm for the transition.
2. **Project Coordination**: For project coordination, I would utilize a **delegative leadership style**. This approach involves empowering team members by assigning specific responsibilities, creating a clear hierarchy, and encouraging individual ownership of tasks. By delegating effectively, this style promotes accountability and ensures that each team member understands their role within the broader project framework. It also allows for more efficient coordination, as team members take initiative within their areas of responsibility while remaining aligned with the overall project goals.
