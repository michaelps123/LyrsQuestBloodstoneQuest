## My "OTN2 — OTN2 Task 1: Self-Assessment"
<br>

##### A "Provide a PDF of your completed CliftonStrengths self-assessment. The evidence must show your name and _all_ **five** strengths.
- See the attached document "CliftonStrengths _ Gallup Access_MichaelSchneider.pdf"
##### A.1   "Discuss the results of the **five** categorical strengths from the CliftonStrengths self-assessment, including what those results indicate about your leadership."
- Throughout my career, I have been recognized as a technically proficient team member and frequently entrusted with leadership and mentoring responsibilities. While I have embraced these opportunities, I’ve done so with a focus on guiding and supporting others rather than directly managing them. My strengths lie in understanding the intricacies of technology and developing processes to achieve objectives, rather than in overseeing people. The results of the CliftonStrengths self-assessment align with this perspective, highlighting my ability to contribute through technical expertise and collaborative guidance. These strengths reinforce my leadership style as one that is mission-focused and process-driven, emphasizing mentorship and team empowerment rather than traditional management.
##### A.2 "Explain how _each_ of your **five** identified strengths from the CliftonStrengths self-assessment influence your thoughts, decisions, and behaviors as the IT manager in the provided scenario."  
- **Input**: I thrive on collecting and organizing data, using it to uncover patterns and insights that inform future actions. This strength allows me to approach challenges systematically, ensuring decisions are grounded in solid information.
- **Intellection**: I am naturally contemplative, taking time to deeply analyze situations before forming opinions or taking action. This deliberative nature ensures that my decisions as an IT manager are well-considered, reducing impulsiveness and fostering thoughtful solutions.
- **Learner**: My passion for learning drives me to continually expand my knowledge across a wide range of subjects, both within and beyond IT. This broad and ever-growing knowledge base allows me to approach problems from multiple perspectives and adapt to new challenges in a rapidly evolving field.
- **Analytical**: Complementing my Input strength, I am motivated to analyze data critically to inform my decision-making process. This analytical approach enables me to identify root causes, assess risks, and make evidence-based decisions that align with organizational goals.
- **Relator**: While I do not require friendship to work effectively with peers, I value developing deeper relationships with colleagues. This preference for small, close-knit teams fosters collaboration, trust, and synergy, creating an environment where team members feel supported and motivated to achieve shared goals.
<br>

#####  B  "Discuss **one** IT leadership goal that will help improve your leadership as the IT manager in the scenario."
- Improving communication is a key leadership goal that will significantly enhance my effectiveness as the IT manager in the scenario. Many of the "key issues identified" are rooted in communication challenges, including adapting communication methods to meet evolving needs, coordinating efforts across the team, and ensuring remote team members remain informed and engaged. Additionally, understanding the needs of junior developers to support their growth and effectively aligning project efforts are critical areas where better communication can drive improvement. By focusing on developing clear, consistent, and adaptive communication strategies, I can foster stronger collaboration, address team concerns, and align efforts to achieve organizational goals.
###### B.1. "Discuss **two** specific actions you will take to support the goal discussed in part B."
1. **Develop a Clear Communication Plan**: I will create a structured plan of action to ensure all team members are well-informed and aligned. This plan will include multiple communication channels, such as emails, group discussions, and one-on-one meetings, to accommodate different preferences and ensure clarity. The focus will be on articulating the project’s end goal, each team member’s role, and how their individual contributions align with the overall objective.
2. **Assign a Dedicated Project Manager**: To enhance coordination and accountability, I will assign a Project Manager to oversee task creation, owner assignments, and the establishment of clear, achievable milestones. This role will complement the overall communication strategy by ensuring that responsibilities are well-defined, progress is tracked, and team members remain engaged and informed throughout the project life cycle.

##### C "Select **two** of the key issues identified in the provided scenario. Recommend a different leadership style for _each_ issue, and explain how your chosen leadership style effectively addresses the issues. Leadership styles can include, but are not limited to, transformational, servant, spiritual, autocratic, or authentic leadership."
1. **Resistance to Change**: To address resistance to change, I would adopt a **transformational leadership style**. This style focuses on inspiring and motivating the team by clearly communicating a compelling vision of the end goal and how achieving it benefits both the team and the organization. By fostering trust, encouraging innovation, and emphasizing the value of the change, a transformational leader can help overcome resistance, align the team with the shared vision, and build enthusiasm for the transition.
2. **Project Coordination**: For project coordination, I would utilize a **delegative leadership style**. This approach involves empowering team members by assigning specific responsibilities, creating a clear hierarchy, and encouraging individual ownership of tasks. By delegating effectively, this style promotes accountability and ensures that each team member understands their role within the broader project framework. It also allows for more efficient coordination, as team members take initiative within their areas of responsibility while remaining aligned with the overall project goals.

###### C.1. "Describe how applying _both_ leadership styles from part C would motivate the team. Provide **two** approaches for _each_ style."
- **Transformational leadership style**:
	1. One approach to motivating the team through transformational leadership is to encourage open communication. By holding regular town halls or team meetings, leadership can address concerns and gather feedback from team members. This will foster a culture of transparency and cooperation, allowing the team to collectively shape the project's trajectory. Recognizing and rewarding contributions can boost morale and drive motivation. By acknowledging the accomplishments of team members, the leader demonstrates appreciation for their hard work, fueling a desire for continued success.
	2. An alternative strategy for the transformational leadership style is an emphasize on the importance of teamwork. By promoting a collaborative environment, the leader encourages individuals to contribute their unique perspectives and talents to the collective effort. This not only broadens the skillset available to the project but also builds stronger interpersonal connections among team members, enhancing overall cohesion and effectiveness.
- **Delegative leadership style**: 
	1. One effective approach of the delegative leadership style is to establish clear, measurable objectives that align with the project's broader goals. By giving team members a tangible understanding of what is expected, leadership enables them to prioritize their efforts accordingly. This helps to minimize distractions, streamline workflows, and ultimately increase productivity.
	2. Another technique for leveraging the delegative leadership style is to provide ongoing coaching and development opportunities. By investing in the growth of team members, leadership equips them with the skills necessary to excel in their roles, ultimately leading to improved job satisfaction and reduced turnover rates. Additionally, empowering employees to assume greater responsibilities can stimulate creativity and problem-solving, driving innovation within the organization.
