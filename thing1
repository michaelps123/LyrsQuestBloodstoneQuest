## My "OTN2 — OTN2 Task 1: Self-Assessment"
<br>

##### A "Provide a PDF of your completed CliftonStrengths self-assessment. The evidence must show your name and _all_ **five** strengths.
- See the attached document "CliftonStrengths _ Gallup Access_MichaelSchneider.pdf"
##### A.1   "Discuss the results of the **five** categorical strengths from the CliftonStrengths self-assessment, including what those results indicate about your leadership."
- The Clifton Strengths self-assessment offers a framework for understanding an individual's unique blend of talents and abilities. The self-assessment allowed me to reflect on my experiences and acknowledge the value I bring to a team. Throughout my career, I have been recognized as a technically proficient and frequently entrusted with leadership and mentoring responsibilities. While I have embraced these opportunities, I’ve done so with a focus on guiding and supporting others. My strengths lie in understanding the intricacies of technology and developing processes to achieve objectives, rather than in managing people. The results of the Clifton Strengths self-assessment align with this perspective, highlighting my ability to contribute through technical expertise and collaborative guidance. These strengths reinforce my leadership style as mission-focused and process-driven, emphasizing mentorship and team empowerment rather than traditional management.

##### A.2 "Explain how _each_ of your **five** identified strengths from the CliftonStrengths self-assessment influence your thoughts, decisions, and behaviors as the IT manager in the provided scenario."  
- **Input**: I thrive on collecting and organizing data, using it to uncover patterns and insights that inform future actions. This strength allows me to approach challenges systematically, ensuring decisions are grounded in solid information. This is true in both technical areas and in human interactions. The more data you have on a subject area, the better you can tune processes, responses, and professional relationships. 
- **Intellection**: I am naturally contemplative, I like to take time to deeply analyze situations before forming opinions and taking any action. This deliberative nature ensures that my decisions as an IT manager are well-considered, reducing impulsiveness and fostering thoughtful solutions. This reduces the opportunity for misspoken words with other team members or making decisions without double-checking for errors.
- **Learner**: My passion for learning drives me to continually expand my knowledge across a wide range of subjects, both within the workplace and personally. This broad and ever-growing knowledge base allows me to approach problems from multiple perspectives and allows me to adapt to new challenges. This is especially important in the rapidly evolving field of IT where changes in tools and the cultural response to these tools are always changing.
- **Analytical**: I believe this strength goes hand-in-hand with the Input strength. I am motivated to analyze data critically to inform my decision-making process. This analytical approach enables me to identify root causes, assess risks, and make evidence-based decisions that align with current technical challenges and with the organization's goals.
- **Relator**: While I do not require friendship to work effectively with peers, I value developing deeper relationships with colleagues. I actively seek opportunities to build genuine connections with my coworkers, believing that a shared sense of purpose and mutual respect is crucial to achieving our common goals.

#####  B  "Discuss **one** IT leadership goal that will help improve your leadership as the IT manager in the scenario."
- Improving communication is a key leadership goal that will significantly enhance my effectiveness as the IT manager in the scenario. Many of the "key issues identified" are rooted in communication challenges, including adapting communication methods to meet evolving needs, coordinating efforts across the team, and ensuring remote team members remain informed and engaged. Additionally, understanding the needs of junior developers to support their growth and effectively aligning project efforts are critical areas where better communication can drive improvement. By focusing on developing clear, consistent, and adaptive communication strategies, I can foster stronger collaboration, address team concerns, and align efforts to achieve organizational goals.
- Based on the "key issues identified", I believe the most important IT leadership goal is to enhance communication effectiveness. Effective communication is crucial for building trust, promoting teamwork, and driving successful outcomes in IT projects. To achieve this goal, I plan to develop a comprehensive communication strategy with tailored messaging to address the diverse needs of stakeholders. This strategy will prioritize transparency, clarity, and inclusivity, ensuring that all voices are heard and valued. Experienced developers need to see the bigger picture to understand the overall impact of changes, remote team members need to be more informed and engaged, and junior developers need to be aware of resources to improve their skill sets and contribute to projects. By focusing on developing clear, consistent, and adaptive communication strategies, I can foster stronger collaboration that addresses team concerns, and align efforts to achieve organizational goals.
###### B.1. "Discuss **two** specific actions you will take to support the goal discussed in part B."
1. **Develop a Clear Communication Plan**: I propose developing a clear communication plan that outlines the objectives and is tailored to the audience. This plan will include multiple communication channels; emails, town hall discussions, and one-on-one meetings. The focus will be on articulating the project’s end goal, demonstrating each team member’s contribution, and how they contribute to the overall objective. By doing so, we can minimize misunderstandings, reduce errors, and promote seamless collaboration across functional silos.
2. **Assign a Dedicated Project Manager**: To enhance coordination and accountability, I would assign a Project Manager. This should be an individual with a proven track record of success in managing complex projects and facilitating cross-functional teams. This individual needs strong interpersonal skills to navigate conflicts and negotiate trade-offs between competing interests. They will be responsible for task ownership and the tracking of achievable milestones. This role will complement the overall communication strategy by ensuring responsibilities are well-defined, progress is tracked, and team members remain engaged and informed throughout the project life cycle.

##### C "Select **two** of the key issues identified in the provided scenario. Recommend a different leadership style for _each_ issue, and explain how your chosen leadership style effectively addresses the issues. Leadership styles can include, but are not limited to, transformational, servant, spiritual, autocratic, or authentic leadership."
1. **Resistance to Change**: To address resistance to change, I would adopt a **transformational leadership style**. This style focuses on inspiring and motivating the team by clearly communicating a compelling vision of the end goal and how achieving it benefits both the team and the organization. By fostering trust, encouraging innovation, and emphasizing the value of the change, a transformational leader can help overcome resistance, align the team with the shared vision, and build enthusiasm for the transition.
2. **Project Coordination**: For project coordination, I would utilize a **delegative leadership style**. This approach involves empowering team members by assigning specific responsibilities, creating a clear hierarchy, and encouraging individual ownership of tasks. By delegating effectively, this style promotes accountability and ensures that each team member understands their role within the broader project framework. It also allows for more efficient coordination, as team members take initiative within their areas of responsibility while remaining aligned with the overall project goals.

###### C.1. "Describe how applying _both_ leadership styles from part C would motivate the team. Provide **two** approaches for _each_ style."
- **Transformational leadership style**:
	1. One approach to motivating the team through transformational leadership is to encourage open communication. By holding regular town halls and focused team meetings, leadership can address concerns and gather feedback from team members. This fosters a culture of transparency and cooperation, allowing the team to collectively shape the project. Recognizing and rewarding contributions can boost morale and drive motivation. By acknowledging the accomplishments of team members, leadership demonstrates appreciation for the team's hard work.
	2. An alternative strategy for the transformational leadership style is an emphasis on the importance of teamwork. By promoting a collaborative environment, leadership encourages individuals to contribute their unique perspectives and talents to the collective effort. This not only broadens the skill set available to the project but also builds stronger interpersonal connections among team members, enhancing overall cohesion and effectiveness.
- **Delegative leadership style**: 
	1. One effective approach of the delegative leadership style is to establish clear, measurable objectives that align with the project's overall goal. By giving team members a tangible understanding of expectations, leadership enables them to prioritize their efforts accordingly. This helps to minimize distractions, tune their workflows, and ultimately increase productivity.
	2. Another technique for leveraging the delegative leadership style is to provide ongoing mentoring and training opportunities. By investing in the growth of team members, leadership equips them with the skills necessary to excel, which will lead to improved job satisfaction. Additionally, empowering employees to assume greater responsibilities can stimulate creativity and problem-solving.
