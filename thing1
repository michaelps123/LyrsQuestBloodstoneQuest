#####  B  "Discuss **one** IT leadership goal that will help improve your leadership as the IT manager in the scenario."
- Improving communication is a key leadership goal that will significantly enhance my effectiveness as the IT manager in the scenario. Many of the "key issues identified" are rooted in communication challenges, including adapting communication methods to meet evolving needs, coordinating efforts across the team, and ensuring remote team members remain informed and engaged. Additionally, understanding the needs of junior developers to support their growth and effectively aligning project efforts are critical areas where better communication can drive improvement. By focusing on developing clear, consistent, and adaptive communication strategies, I can foster stronger collaboration, address team concerns, and align efforts to achieve organizational goals.
###### B.1. "Discuss **two** specific actions you will take to support the goal discussed in part B."
1. **Develop a Clear Communication Plan**: I will create a structured plan of action to ensure all team members are well-informed and aligned. This plan will include multiple communication channels, such as emails, group discussions, and one-on-one meetings, to accommodate different preferences and ensure clarity. The focus will be on articulating the project’s end goal, each team member’s role, and how their individual contributions align with the overall objective.
2. **Assign a Dedicated Project Manager**: To enhance coordination and accountability, I will assign a Project Manager to oversee task creation, owner assignments, and the establishment of clear, achievable milestones. This role will complement the overall communication strategy by ensuring that responsibilities are well-defined, progress is tracked, and team members remain engaged and informed throughout the project life cycle.
