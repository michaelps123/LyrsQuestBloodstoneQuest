#####  B  "Discuss **one** IT leadership goal that will help improve your leadership as the IT manager in the scenario."
- Based on the "key issues identified", I believe the most important IT leadership goal is to enhance communication effectiveness. Effective communication is crucial for building trust, promoting teamwork, and driving successful outcomes in IT projects. To achieve this goal, I plan to develop a comprehensive communication strategy with tailored messaging to address the diverse needs of stakeholders. This strategy will prioritize transparency, clarity, and inclusivity, ensuring that all voices are heard and valued. Experienced developers need to see the bigger picture to understand the overall impact of changes, remote team members need to be more informed and engaged, and junior developers need to be aware of resources to improve their skill sets and contribute to projects. By focusing on developing clear, consistent, and adaptive communication strategies, I can foster stronger collaboration that address team concerns, and align efforts to achieve organizational goals.
###### B.1. "Discuss **two** specific actions you will take to support the goal discussed in part B."
1. **Develop a Clear Communication Plan**: I propose developing a clear communication plan that outlines the objectives and is tailored to the audience. This plan will include multiple communication channels; emails, group discussions, and one-on-one meetings. The focus will be on articulating the project’s end goal, demonstrating each team member’s contribution, and how they contribute to the overall objective. By doing so, we can minimize misunderstandings, reduce errors, and promote seamless collaboration across functional silos.
2. **Assign a Dedicated Project Manager**: To enhance coordination and accountability, I would assign a Project Manager. This should be an individual with a proven track record of success in managing complex projects and facilitating cross-functional teams. This individual needs strong interpersonal skills to navigate conflicts and negotiate trade-offs between competing interests. They will be responsible for task ownership and the tracking of achievable milestones. This role will complement the overall communication strategy by ensuring responsibilities are well-defined, progress is tracked, and team members remain engaged and informed throughout the project life cycle.
