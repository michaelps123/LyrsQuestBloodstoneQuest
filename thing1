##### A.2 "Explain how _each_ of your **five** identified strengths from the CliftonStrengths self-assessment influence your thoughts, decisions, and behaviors as the IT manager in the provided scenario."  
- **Input**: I thrive on collecting and organizing data, using it to uncover patterns and insights that inform future actions. This strength allows me to approach challenges systematically, ensuring decisions are grounded in solid information.
- **Intellection**: I am naturally contemplative, taking time to deeply analyze situations before forming opinions or taking action. This deliberative nature ensures that my decisions as an IT manager are well-considered, reducing impulsiveness and fostering thoughtful solutions.
- **Learner**: My passion for learning drives me to continually expand my knowledge across a wide range of subjects, both within and beyond IT. This broad and ever-growing knowledge base allows me to approach problems from multiple perspectives and adapt to new challenges in a rapidly evolving field.
- **Analytical**: Complementing my Input strength, I am motivated to analyze data critically to inform my decision-making process. This analytical approach enables me to identify root causes, assess risks, and make evidence-based decisions that align with organizational goals.
- **Relator**: While I do not require friendship to work effectively with peers, I value developing deeper relationships with colleagues. This preference for small, close-knit teams fosters collaboration, trust, and synergy, creating an environment where team members feel supported and motivated to achieve shared goals.
