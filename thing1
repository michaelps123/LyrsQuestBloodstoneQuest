#####  B  "Discuss **one** IT leadership goal that will help improve your leadership as the IT manager in the scenario."
- Based on the "key issues identified", I believe the most important IT leadership goal is to enhance communication effectiveness. Effective communication is crucial for building trust, promoting teamwork, and driving successful outcomes in IT projects. To achieve this goal, I plan to develop a comprehensive communication strategy with tailored messaging to address the diverse needs of stakeholders. This strategy will prioritize transparency, clarity, and inclusivity, ensuring that all voices are heard and valued. Experienced developers need to see the bigger picture to understand the overall impact of changes, remote team members need to be more informed and engaged, and junior developers need to be aware of resources to improve their skill sets and contribute to projects. By focusing on developing clear, consistent, and adaptive communication strategies, I can foster stronger collaboration that address team concerns, and align efforts to achieve organizational goals.
###### B.1. "Discuss **two** specific actions you will take to support the goal discussed in part B."
1. **Develop a Clear Communication Plan**: I will create a structured plan of action to ensure all team members are well-informed and aligned. This plan will include multiple communication channels, such as emails, group discussions, and one-on-one meetings, to accommodate different preferences and ensure clarity. The focus will be on articulating the project’s end goal, each team member’s role, and how their individual contributions align with the overall objective.
2. **Assign a Dedicated Project Manager**: To enhance coordination and accountability, I will assign a Project Manager to oversee task creation, owner assignments, and the establishment of clear, achievable milestones. This role will complement the overall communication strategy by ensuring that responsibilities are well-defined, progress is tracked, and team members remain engaged and informed throughout the project life cycle.
