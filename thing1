##### C "Select **two** of the key issues identified in the provided scenario. Recommend a different leadership style for _each_ issue, and explain how your chosen leadership style effectively addresses the issues. Leadership styles can include, but are not limited to, transformational, servant, spiritual, autocratic, or authentic leadership."
1. **Resistance to Change**: To address resistance to change, I would adopt a **transformational leadership style**. This style focuses on inspiring and motivating the team by clearly communicating a compelling vision of the end goal and how achieving it benefits both the team and the organization. By fostering trust, encouraging innovation, and emphasizing the value of the change, a transformational leader can help overcome resistance, align the team with the shared vision, and build enthusiasm for the transition.
2. **Project Coordination**: For project coordination, I would utilize a **delegative leadership style**. This approach involves empowering team members by assigning specific responsibilities, creating a clear hierarchy, and encouraging individual ownership of tasks. By delegating effectively, this style promotes accountability and ensures that each team member understands their role within the broader project framework. It also allows for more efficient coordination, as team members take initiative within their areas of responsibility while remaining aligned with the overall project goals.

###### C.1. "Describe how applying _both_ leadership styles from part C would motivate the team. Provide **two** approaches for _each_ style."
- **Transformational leadership style**:
	1. One approach to motivating the team through transformational leadership is to encourage open communication. By holding regular town halls or team meetings, leadership can address concerns and gather feedback from team members. This will foster a culture of transparency and cooperation, allowing the team to collectively shape the project's trajectory. Recognizing and rewarding contributions can boost morale and drive motivation. By acknowledging the accomplishments of team members, the leader demonstrates appreciation for their hard work, fueling a desire for continued success.
	2. An alternative strategy for the transformational leadership style is an emphasize on the importance of teamwork. By promoting a collaborative environment, the leader encourages individuals to contribute their unique perspectives and talents to the collective effort. This not only broadens the skillset available to the project but also builds stronger interpersonal connections among team members, enhancing overall cohesion and effectiveness.
- **Delegative leadership style**: 
	1. One effective approach of the delegative leadership style is to establish clear, measurable objectives that align with the project's broader goals. By giving team members a tangible understanding of what is expected, leadership enables them to prioritize their efforts accordingly. This helps to minimize distractions, streamline workflows, and ultimately increase productivity.
	2. Another technique for leveraging the delegative leadership style is to provide ongoing coaching and development opportunities. By investing in the growth of team members, leadership equips them with the skills necessary to excel in their roles, ultimately leading to improved job satisfaction and reduced turnover rates. Additionally, empowering employees to assume greater responsibilities can stimulate creativity and problem-solving, driving innovation within the organization.
